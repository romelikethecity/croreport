## The Problem

When hiring AEs, managers ask "Do you know MEDDPICC?" and candidates say "Yes." But:
- No structured way to assess *depth* of knowledge
- Candidates can recite definitions without real application
- Interviewers don't know what "good" looks like
- Hiring decisions become gut-feel, not data-driven

---

A Google Sheet with:
1. **Interview question bank** (15-20 questions across difficulty levels)

3. **Candidate comparison view** (stack-rank multiple candidates)
4. **Red flag checklist** (automatic warnings)

## Scoring Rubric Structure

### Rating Scale

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Awareness | Can define terms but no real application |
| 2 | Competent | Has used MEDDPICC, basic examples |
| 3 | Proficient | Strong examples, understands nuance |
| 4 | Expert | Teaches others, adapts framework creatively |

---

## Assessment Categories

### Category 1: Framework Knowledge (20%)
*Can they explain MEDDPICC accurately?*

**Question:** "Walk me through MEDDPICC — what does each letter mean and why does it matter?"

| Score | What You Hear |
|-------|---------------|
| 1 | Gets letters wrong, mixes up definitions, surface-level |
| 2 | Correct definitions, but textbook — no personal insight |
| 3 | Accurate + adds context on why each matters in real deals |
| 4 | Nuanced understanding, can explain variations (MEDDIC vs MEDDPICC vs MEDDICC) |

---

### Category 2: Pain & Metrics (20%)
*Can they uncover and quantify pain?*

**Question:** "Tell me about a deal where you uncovered pain that the customer didn't initially articulate. How did you quantify it?"

| Score | What You Hear |
|-------|---------------|
| 1 | Describes product features, not customer pain |
| 2 | Identifies pain but can't quantify business impact |
| 3 | Clear pain → metric connection with specific numbers |
| 4 | Multi-level pain (business, department, personal) all quantified |

**Follow-up:** "What questions do you ask to implicate pain?"

---

### Category 3: Champion Identification & Testing (25%)
*This is the most important skill — weight it accordingly*

**Question:** "Describe your champion in your last closed deal. How did you know they were a true champion vs. a coach?"

| Score | What You Hear |
|-------|---------------|
| 1 | Confuses champion with "friendly contact" or decision-maker |
| 2 | Understands definition but no testing methodology |
| 3 | Clear champion criteria + describes how they tested |
| 4 | Multiple test methods, developed champion over time, can explain failures |

**Follow-up Questions:**
- "How do you test if someone will sell for you when you're not in the room?"
- "Tell me about a time your 'champion' turned out to be just a coach. What happened?"

---

### Category 4: Economic Buyer Access (15%)
*Can they navigate to power?*

**Question:** "How do you identify and access the Economic Buyer? Give me a specific example."

| Score | What You Hear |
|-------|---------------|
| 1 | Assumes the person they're talking to has budget authority |
| 2 | Knows to ask but doesn't have a systematic approach |
| 3 | Clear discovery questions, uses champion to access EB |
| 4 | Multi-threaded approach, validates EB through paper process questions |

**Red Flag Questions:**
- "Who signs the contract?" → They should ask this early
- "Has the EB ever killed a deal you thought was done?" → Expect yes with learnings

---

### Category 5: Decision Process & Paper Process (10%)
*Do they avoid late-stage surprises?*

**Question:** "Walk me through how you map a customer's buying process. When do you ask about procurement/legal?"

| Score | What You Hear |
|-------|---------------|
| 1 | "I figure it out at the end" or "Procurement always slows things down" |
| 2 | Asks about process but not until late stages |
| 3 | Maps process in discovery, builds into timeline |
| 4 | Creates mutual action plans, knows procurement triggers, builds relationships with legal |

---

### Category 6: Competition Strategy (10%)
*Strategic thinking, not feature wars*

**Question:** "How do you handle a deal where the competitor is already entrenched?"

| Score | What You Hear |
|-------|---------------|
| 1 | Feature comparison, discounting |
| 2 | Tries to change criteria but no structured approach |
| 3 | Knows direct/divide/indirect/delay strategies |
| 4 | Situational strategy selection, can explain when to walk away |
