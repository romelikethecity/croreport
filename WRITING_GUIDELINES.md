# CRO Report Writing Guidelines

## Patterns to Avoid

1. **"Translation:" asides** - Don't explain what you just wrote. If the writing needs translation, rewrite it.

2. **Signposting significance** - "The timing is significant" or "This is important" - if it's significant, the reader will figure it out from the facts.

3. **"It's not X, it's Y" pattern** - "You're not inheriting a mature org — you're scaling one" or "These aren't pilots — they're deployed contracts." This is an AI trope. Just state what it is.

4. **Em dashes** - Obvious AI tell. Use commas or rewrite the sentence.

5. **Stating the obvious** - "The comp is transparent" (just state the comp), "If you're looking for fully remote, this isn't it" (executive roles aren't fully remote).

6. **Editorializing quality** - "The investor lineup is impressive" or "Serious customer logos" - just list the investors/customers and let readers judge.

7. **Patronizing advice** - "Negotiate base toward $250K" or "Get commission structure in writing" - VP-level readers know how to negotiate. Don't give basic career advice.

8. **Hokey predictions** - "First 90 Days" sections with speculative milestones nobody will track.

9. **Redundant hedging** - "Should hopefully" - pick one word, not both.

## Voice and Tone

- State facts directly without meta-commentary about their significance
- Trust the audience (senior sales execs) to draw conclusions and know their craft
- Cut anything that feels like explaining or softening
- Write like a peer sharing intel, not a consultant adding caveats

## Newsletter Spec

Every newsletter must include:
- Title with three elements: Market stat + Exec hire + Company deep-dive
- "Who's Moving" section announcing a NEW executive hire with background
- "Company Deep-Dive" section with: Funding, Leadership Intel, Why Compelling, Red Flags, Critical Questions, Compensation Breakdown
