# Landing Page Best Practices

## Title Approaches

There are three primary ways to write a great title:

### 1. Explain What You Do
When your product is unique, simply explain what you do as clearly as possible.

**Examples:**
- Quantum: "Coffee-Infused Energy Bars"
- Muzzle: "Silence embarrassing notifications while screensharing"
- Veles: "97% of this cleaner is made from food waste"
- Fast: "One click. No passwords. The world's fastest checkout."

### 2. Use Hooks
Most products aren't unique. A hook adds oomph. The easiest way to write hooks is to **address your customer's biggest objection**.

**Formula:** Value → Objection → Value + Hook

| Value | Objection | Value + Hook |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Rank higher on Google | "I suck at SEO" | "You don't have to be an SEO pro to rank higher on Google" |
| Ace the SAT | "I bet it's hard work" | "Ace the SAT with just 10 minutes of studying per day" |
| Erectile dysfunction pills | "I can't ask my doctor" | "Erectile dysfunction pills. Direct to your door" |

### 3. Own Your Niche
Some startups transcend hooks. Own your niche in one line. Write with conviction. You're THE solution.

**Examples:**
- Privy: "How Small Brands Sell More Online"
- Basecamp: "The All-In-One Toolkit For Working Remotely"
- Descript: "It's How You Make a Podcast"
- SparkLoop: "The Referral Tool for Newsletters"

## Hero Section Best Practices

- **Headline:** Under 8 words / 44 characters max
- **Subheadline:** Benefit-focused, not feature-focused
- **Lead with pain or FOMO** when applicable
- **Be specific** — concrete beats abstract
- **First-person CTAs outperform** ("Get My Brief" vs "Get Your Brief")

## Additional Guidelines

- Social proof placement significantly impacts conversion
- Benefit + time formula converts well ("Become smarter in just 5 minutes")
- Address "What's in it for me?" and "How much time will this take?"
- Page speed directly impacts conversion rates
- Fewer form fields don't always mean more conversions
