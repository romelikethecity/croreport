Our mission is to free people from tedious work with collaborative robots, and to solve the critical labor shortages faced by farmers and others that work outdoors.

To accomplish our mission, we need a world-class, diverse team where everyone feels empowered and comfortable sharing their ideas. With this in mind, we strive to create a work environment where every employee can be themselves and express their perspective – this enables us to deliver the most creative and innovative solutions to problems our customers face.

Headquartered in Philadelphia with an office in central California, and backed by top autonomy investors, including Translink, Catalyst, S2G, Cibus, FPrime, Toyota Ventures, FFVC, Xplorer, and Radicle, Burro was created to solve the labor shortages facing agriculture and other industries outdoors, using robotics.

Burros can be described as Disney's Wall-E for agriculture and work outdoors, in a pragmatic version 1.0 format. Today, Burros are people-scale to small-vehicle-scale (<1500 lb) autonomous ground vehicles that autonomously haul, tow, mow, spray, and patrol to save labor - these five tasks, are the most ubiquitous jobs to be done outdoors. While Burros work, each one is online and processes 5 TB / hour of run time / robot and sends novelty back, enabling the entire fleet to get smarter daily. Burros are designed to lay the base for the fully autonomous future of work outdoors.

  

We have sold over 700 Burros to date and have done over 100 years of autonomous driving. Roughly 70% of our sales are through dealers, and our customers operate Burros in nurseries, vineyards, berries, industrial sites, construction sites, and beyond. Demand for our product is exploding, and we are seeking a Chief Revenue Officer to join our leadership team and take our sales, customer success, and marketing team to the next level of growth (expanding our current 2.3X growth rate towards 3X plus, and growing us from 700 systems sold to over 1000 in the next 12 months).

The ideal candidate is a data-driven, empathetic, high-EQ and high-IQ leader, who enjoys rolling up their sleeves to get things done at a startup-style player/coach stage, while also creating and enabling infrastructure and team practices that unlock faster, more repeatable, and more scalable growth.

Vow is a cultured meat company on a mission to feed billions and create food that’s good for your taste buds, your health, and your planet.

They're bringing together cutting-edge innovations in science, engineering, culinary and design to create new meats that meat lovers can choose selfishly because it’s nutritious and delicious, and are doing so in a sustainable way.

  

**The Role**

In the background, they've been (not so quietly) reinventing cultured meat, taking it from hype to haute cuisine. They're turning breakthrough science into real-world impact at a global scale.

Having launched in Singapore and more recently Australia, they've got exciting growth plans and are looking for a passionate, commercial executive to commercialise their existing and upcoming products at scale.

This is a pivotal role: as CCO, you will own the strategy and execution of Vow’s commercial expansion. You’ll translate their internal capabilities into compelling propositions, build structured partnership pipelines, and secure collaborations that accelerate revenue, validation, and long-term scale.  
  

This role sits at the intersection of commercial strategy, business development and execution. You’ll work closely with R&D, product, manufacturing and leadership to define where Vow plays, who they partner with, and how they bring novel products to market.

This is a role for someone who can think big, act fast, and thrive in ambiguity.

**The Experience / Skills You Will Bring**

* 15+ years of experience in strategic sales, business development or partnerships within food ingredients, CPG, food, cosmetics or adjacent industries
* Demonstrated track record of successful P&L ownership, including developing and executing sales strategies, aligned with profitability targets.

* Strong negotiation and interpersonal skills, with experience working across diverse internal and external stakeholders
* High levels of integrity, professionalism and leadership, with the ability to inspire confidence and momentum

  
You Will

Build and own Vow’s commercial strategy

* Develop and execute a clear, structured partnerships and co-development strategy aligned to Vow’s product roadmap and long-term vision
* Build a high-quality pipeline of target partners across food, ingredients, and adjacent industries
* Define priority segments, revenue pathways and partnership models (e.g. co-development, licensing, JVs, supply agreements)

Translate science into commercial reality

* Work closely with internal teams to deeply understand Vow’s current and future products, capabilities and constraints
* Convert technical and operational capabilities into coherent, credible commercial pitches
* Lead early-stage partner conversations, from first meeting through to commercial agreements

Execute while iterating (startup-style)

* Balance strategic thinking with hands-on execution, moving deals forward while refining the broader strategy
* Navigate ambiguity and incomplete information without defaulting to long “thinking phases”
* Secure and manage early trials, pilots and paid engagements that validate commercial demand

  

**What Success Looks Like**

Within 3 Months, You Will

* Have a deep understanding of Vow’s product portfolio (current and upcoming), value propositions, and the problems they solve
* Build a strong commercial map of companies and sectors that align with Vow’s capabilities
* Establish credibility and trust across internal teams as the owner of strategic partnerships

Within 6 Months, You Will

* Have a clearly defined partnerships strategy and structured pipeline
* Articulate a compelling co-development strategy: who to approach, why, and with what proposition
* Prioritise revenue pathways and target segments
* Initiate external engagement, take first meetings, and begin pitching at least one application area
* Demonstrate the ability to consistently translate internal capabilities into strong external narratives

Within 12 Months, You Will

* Secure multiple paid agreements, trials or pilots with target partners (even if initially small in $ value)
* Clearly define role-mission outcomes over a 1–3 year horizon
* Be actively iterating and executing the commercial strategy in parallel
* Secure strategic partnerships, co-development agreements or joint ventures with global food, ingredient or cosmetic players

**Who They Are And Why Join**

* They are building a diverse, mission-led dream team of “Vowzers.” Their mission is to make food products for everyone. To do that well, they need a workforce that’s representative of the people we serve. They celebrate multiple approaches and points of view - so they're building a culture to match. Be yourself and come as you are.
* Work on cutting-edge technology. They're bringing together cutting-edge innovations in science, engineering, and food, to recreate the world’s most tantalising and unique culinary experiences. All without compromising on ethics or our planet along the way. Since their inception in 2019, they have held the title of being the first startup to cultivate meat from the cells of an undomesticated animal, been called The Spaceship of the cultured meat industry by Forbes and launched their first product under the brand Forged in some of the hottest restaurants in Singapore.
* Work with and learn from the best. Their team includes some of the world’s top scientists, innovators, operators, and creatives with decades of industry experience. Despite experiences, they all strive to build, break, learn, and repeat. They see the impossible as temporary and strive to learn and support their company and fellow Vowzers' growth as much as possible.

Backed by Y Combinator and supported by a roster of leading technologists and investors—including DoorDash co-founder Stanley Tang, NFL Hall of Famer Joe Montana, Gmail creator Paul Buchheit, and Twitch co-founder Justin Kan—Nabis is redefining how cannabis moves, sells, and scales. Our long-term vision is to become the foundational infrastructure layer for cannabis commerce nationwide and the largest distributor of cannabis products in the world.

**The Role**
============

Nabis is seeking a Vice President of Sales to help architect, operate, and scale our next-generation commercial engine as we transition from a high-performing operator into a national infrastructure platform.

This is not a traditional sales leadership role. The VP of Sales will be responsible for building a technology-driven, data-informed, and economically disciplined sales system where software, workflows, and intelligence are the primary growth levers—and human sales teams are deployed selectively where they create the most leverage.

Reporting directly to the President, this role will partner closely with Product, Data, Operations, Finance, and Marketplace leadership to ensure sales reinforces platform adoption, margin expansion, and scalable national growth.

**What Success Looks Like**
===========================

The VP of Sales will help Nabis evolve sales from a collection of functions into a cohesive revenue system that:

* Drives GMV growth while expanding contribution margin
* Accelerates adoption of Marketplace, VMI, financial products, and enterprise workflows
* Scales across new states without linear headcount growth
* Positions Nabis as the default infrastructure partner—not just a distributor

**Responsibilities**
====================

**Revenue Strategy & Architecture**
-----------------------------------

* Own and evolve the end-to-end sales strategy across:
* + Centralized Selling Systems and Teams
  + - Key Account Sales (KASM)
    - Retail Account Managers
    - Sales Enablement Across the Broader Organization
  + Field Sales
* Translate company growth goals into clear commercial priorities and execution plans
* Design sales motions that scale through technology, automation, and platform leverage

**Sales as an Adjunct to Technology**
-------------------------------------

* Ensure sales efforts reinforce adoption of:
* + Marketplace ordering
  + VMI / auto-replenishment
  + Enterprise integrations and workflows
  + Data and analytics tools
* Partner with Product and Data to embed **Data**  **Insights**  **Intelligence** into the sales motion
* Reduce reliance on manual selling by operationalizing automation, workflows, and AI-driven recommendations

**Enterprise & Strategic Account Leadership**
---------------------------------------------

* Own strategy for enterprise and multi-state accounts
* Structure and negotiate regional and national commercial agreements
* Ensure consistent execution across markets while preserving local nuance
* Serve as a senior executive presence for top brands and retail partners

**Commercial Discipline & Unit Economics**
------------------------------------------

* Lead sales with a strong P&L and unit economics mindset
* Drive growth while protecting:
* + Contribution margin
  + DSOs and credit quality
  + Operational capacity and service levels
* Partner with Finance and Operations to ensure sales behavior improves—not degrades—economic performance

**Team Design, Incentives & Enablement**
----------------------------------------

* Design lean, high-leverage sales org structures that scale with technology, not headcount
* Build compensation and incentive plans that reward:
* + Platform adoption
  + Multi-service penetration
  + Long-term customer value
* Develop future sales leaders with strong analytical and cross-functional capability

**What This Role Is Not**
-------------------------

* This is **not** a ""hire reps and set quotas"" role
* + While that is part of the role it is not the only objective
* This is **not** a pure field sales leadership position
* This is **not** a brand-side sales function divorced from operations and finance

Candidates who rely on headcount growth, intuition over data, or hero-driven selling will not succeed in this role.

**Qualifications**
------------------

* 10–15+ years of experience in sales or revenue leadership roles
* Proven experience building and scaling sales organizations in:
* + Infrastructure
  + Logistics
  + Marketplaces
  + Regulated or operationally complex industries (e.g., alcohol, healthcare, fintech, supply chain, cannabis)
* Demonstrated success scaling revenue without linear headcount growth
* Strong understanding of unit economics, margin management, and forecasting
* Experience operating at the intersection of Sales, Product, and Operations
* Data-driven decision-maker with strong analytical instincts
* Executive-level communication skills with credibility across functions
* Comfortable operating in ambiguity and building from first principles
* Prior experience in cannabis or highly regulated industries is a plus (Alcohol, CPG, Cannabis, Etc.)

**Leadership Attributes**
-------------------------

* Executive presence with the ability to build trust across brands, retailers, and internal teams
* Proven ability to lead and align diverse personalities, working styles, and incentives toward shared outcomes
* Strong judgment and emotional intelligence, particularly in high-stakes, ambiguous, or fast-changing situations
* + Disciplined, pragmatic, and execution-oriented
* Charismatic in a grounded, credible way—able to influence and inspire without theatrics
* + Systems thinker who values workflows over heroics
* Low ego, high ownership leadership style
* + Proven ability to lead and align diverse personalities, working styles, and incentives toward shared outcomes
  + - Deep respect for operational excellence and cross-functional collaboration
Comfortable letting technology—not headcount—do the heavy lifting  

**Why This Role Matters**
-------------------------

Nabis has built the infrastructure, validated the economics, and proven the model. The next phase is about owning the market.

The VP of Sales will play a critical role in ensuring sales becomes a durable competitive advantage—one that compounds with technology, scales nationally, and supports Nabis' path to $500M+ in revenue and beyond.

  

**WHY YOU'LL LOVE WORKING AT NABIS!**
-------------------------------------

* You'll work at the fastest growing cannabis startup in the U.S. and architect the future of the cannabis industry's technological infrastructure
* Competitive salary and equity packages.
* + Base Salary starting at $200,000 + Bonus
  + Additional compensation: Equity available, but dependent on experience level
* Medical/Dental/Vision offered to all full-time employees: 75% of employee premium paid by Nabis.
* 401(k) plan with a match.
