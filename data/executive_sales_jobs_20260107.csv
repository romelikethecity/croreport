* **Optimize process:** Build repeatable sales and account management processes across outreach, onboarding, and the ongoing relationship to cost-effectively deepen engagement, drive retention, and maximize long-term referral volume
* **Evolve our systems and tools to enable rapid scale:** Advance our use of Hubspot as a CRM, data dashboards, automated outreach tools, and other technology to enable rapid scale – with a particular emphasis on leaning into the advancements that new AI tools provide
* **Partner cross-functionally to maximize impact:** Collaborate with Product, Operations, and Clinical teams to ensure the referral experience is seamless, feedback loops are tight, and growth forecasts align with provider supply
* **Maintain relationships with key partners and lead our provider council:** Deeply understand clinical workflows, patient needs, and the realities of care delivery to continue to position Seven Starling as a trusted extension of OBGYN practices

### **Who You Are**

* **Experienced sales leader:** 8-10+ years of experience in sales, with 2+ years leading sales or revenue teams at the Director or VP level, owning quotas and key KPIs end-to-end
* **Healthcare native:** 3+ years working in healthcare, ideally with hands-on experience building referral relationships with clinics and providers
* **Data-driven decision maker:** Highly analytical and fluent in sales metrics, funnel health, and forecasting. You instinctively use data to diagnose problems, prioritize action, and hold teams accountable to outcomes
* **Strategic sales operator:** Track record of building and executing sales strategies that drive measurable growth, including both new partner acquisition and account management
* **Startup scaler:** Proven experience in startups, with experience at Series A–C companies strongly preferred. You’ve built or scaled sales functions from early traction through scale.
