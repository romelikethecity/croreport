WFS is a high performance RevOps agency that installs and deploys enterprise-grade, AI-driven revenue engines and selling systems for our clients. Think of a lead generation based marketing agency…. But focused on sales Put simply, our clients outsource their sales department to us and we sell their services to help them scale faster than ever before while changing as many people’s lives as possible. We architect entire end-to-end sales solutions by designing custom sales motions, integrating battle-tested systems, developing go to market strategies powered by our proprietary playbooks, and then hiring, training, and managing a highly trained on demand sales force to deploy faster and more predictable revenue engines.

In short, we’re a full-stack RevOps implementation partner that installs full cycle turnkey selling systems for our clients.

### **Position Overview**

The Vice President of Sales is the most leveraged revenue operator at WFS. This role exists to scale sales performance through managers, not by closing deals personally. The VP of Sales owns the entire sales management motion and is accountable for the results produced by Sales Directors and their teams across all brands.

As WFS scales, the hardest problem to solve is scaling decision-making. This role ensures that Sales Directors are trained, coached, and audited to make the same decisions leadership would make—without constant escalation. Your success is measured by the distance between executive leadership and day-to-day sales operations: when the system works, leadership doesn’t need to be in the weeds.

This is a highly operational, execution-first role. You will own onboarding and integration of new accounts, audit qualitative and quantitative management daily, design how offers are sold, prevent revenue leakage, and deliver company-wide sales training. You are both the architect and auditor of how revenue is generated at scale.

### **You SHOULD apply if…**

* You have led multi-team, multi-brand sales organizations through managers (Sales Directors, not just reps).
* You are exceptional at managing managers and holding leaders accountable to outcomes, not activity theater.
* You are fluent in CRMs, pipeline dashboards, scoreboards, and activity reports and use them daily.
* You can quickly identify revenue leakage, diagnose the root cause, and implement corrective action.
* You are confident making hiring, firing, and development decisions using performance data and clear standards.
* You enjoy building sales training, enablement, talk tracks, and pitch frameworks at scale.
* You can own onboarding and integration of new accounts without chaos, confusion, or dropped balls.
* You are calm under pressure and decisive when revenue is on the line.
* You naturally think in systems, leverage, and repeatability.
* You want real ownership of outcomes—not just influence without accountability.

### **You SHOULD NOT apply if…**

* You want to be a hands-on closer rather than a manager of managers.
* You have never directly owned revenue forecasting and pipeline health.
* You avoid difficult performance conversations or hesitate to terminate low performers.
* You prefer strategy decks, vision docs, or brainstorming over execution and inspection.
* You rely on intuition, vibes, or anecdotes instead of data to make decisions.
* You struggle to stay organized across multiple brands, priorities, and teams.
* You need consensus before taking ownership or making decisions.
* You are uncomfortable operating in a high-velocity, high-accountability environment.
* You want autonomy without visibility or accountability.

### **Major Roles & Responsibilities**

**Sales Leadership & Manager Accountability**

* Own the performance of all Sales Directors and the results produced by their teams.
* Audit and enforce all sales management activity KPIs on a weekly basis.
* Review scoreboards weekly with Sales Directors to identify trends, underperformance, and required personnel decisions.
* Ensure Sales Directors are making effective hiring, firing, and development decisions to maximize rep performance.

**Onboarding, Integration & Sales Motion Ownership**

* Take full ownership of sales decisions during onboarding and integration of new accounts.
* Lead integration calls related to staffing, compensation plans, and sales motion design.
* Design and refine pitch frameworks and talk tracks for new offers and brands.
* Ensure all new sales engines are launched with the correct funnels and go-to-market strategy.

**Pipeline, Forecasting & Revenue Leakage Prevention**

* Audit pipeline management reports and CRM activity logs daily across all brands.
* Ensure dashboards, reports, and activity indicators remain healthy with no hidden red flags.
* Identify and correct revenue leakage through pipeline audits and scoreboard analysis.
* Own forecasting accuracy and ensure Sales Directors can always speak to revenue projections.

**Qualitative Sales Management & Enablement**

* Audit Sales Director management trackers daily, including call reviews, rep development logs, objections, FAQs, and insights.
* Review call analyses completed by Sales Directors and provide direct feedback on coaching quality and focus.
* Identify trends across brands to inform training topics, talk track improvements, and sales material needs.

**Training, Sales Engineering & One-to-Many Enablement**

* Own all company-wide sales training and curriculum.
* Ensure training content is up to date and aligned with core revenue-driving levers.
* Create and deliver recurring company-wide trainings.
* Drive sales engineering initiatives including pitch improvements, objection frameworks, closing decks, and supporting sales materials.

**Capacity Planning & Cross-Functional Alignment**

* Ensure all brands are staffed to capacity and hiring demand is clearly communicated.
* Act as the primary bridge between Sales Directors and Talent Acquisition.
* Partner with Marketing on lead flow, funnel health, and performance feedback.
* Collaborate with leadership on account growth, scaling initiatives, and strategic priorities.

### **What Success Looks Like (First 12 Months)**

* Sales Directors operate autonomously with clear accountability and strong decision-making.
* Revenue forecasts are accurate, visible, and trusted by leadership.
* Minimal revenue leakage across pipelines and funnels.
* Consistent month-over-month growth driven by scalable systems, not heroics.
* A sales organization that performs at a high level without executive micromanagement.

**Bottom line:** This role is for a true sales operator who wants full ownership of revenue execution through people, process, and data. If you know how to scale sales by building elite managers—and you want the scoreboard to prove it—this is your seat.

This role ensures that Sales Directors are trained, coached, and audited to make the same decisions leadership would make—without constant escalation. Your success is measured by the distance between executive leadership and day-to-day sales operations: when the system works, leadership doesn’t need to be in the weeds.

This is a highly operational, execution-first role. You will own onboarding and integration of new accounts, audit qualitative and quantitative management daily, design how offers are sold, prevent revenue leakage, and deliver company-wide sales training. You are both the architect and auditor of how revenue is generated at scale.

### **You SHOULD apply if…**

* You have led multi-team, multi-brand sales organizations through managers (Sales Directors, not just reps).
* You are exceptional at managing managers and holding leaders accountable to outcomes, not activity theater.
* You are fluent in CRMs, pipeline dashboards, scoreboards, and activity reports and use them daily.
* You can quickly identify revenue leakage, diagnose the root cause, and implement corrective action.
* You are confident making hiring, firing, and development decisions using performance data and clear standards.
* You enjoy building sales training, enablement, talk tracks, and pitch frameworks at scale.
* You can own onboarding and integration of new accounts without chaos, confusion, or dropped balls.
* You are calm under pressure and decisive when revenue is on the line.
* You naturally think in systems, leverage, and repeatability.
* You want real ownership of outcomes—not just influence without accountability.

### **You SHOULD NOT apply if…**

* You want to be a hands-on closer rather than a manager of managers.
* You have never directly owned revenue forecasting and pipeline health.
* You avoid difficult performance conversations or hesitate to terminate low performers.
* You prefer strategy decks, vision docs, or brainstorming over execution and inspection.
* You rely on intuition, vibes, or anecdotes instead of data to make decisions.
* You struggle to stay organized across multiple brands, priorities, and teams.
* You need consensus before taking ownership or making decisions.
* You are uncomfortable operating in a high-velocity, high-accountability environment.
* You want autonomy without visibility or accountability.

### **Major Roles & Responsibilities**

**Sales Leadership & Manager Accountability**

* Own the performance of all Sales Directors and the results produced by their teams.
* Audit and enforce all sales management activity KPIs on a weekly basis.
* Review scoreboards weekly with Sales Directors to identify trends, underperformance, and required personnel decisions.
* Ensure Sales Directors are making effective hiring, firing, and development decisions to maximize rep performance.

**Onboarding, Integration & Sales Motion Ownership**

* Take full ownership of sales decisions during onboarding and integration of new accounts.
* Lead integration calls related to staffing, compensation plans, and sales motion design.
* Design and refine pitch frameworks and talk tracks for new offers and brands.
* Ensure all new sales engines are launched with the correct funnels and go-to-market strategy.

**Pipeline, Forecasting & Revenue Leakage Prevention**

* Audit pipeline management reports and CRM activity logs daily across all brands.
* Ensure dashboards, reports, and activity indicators remain healthy with no hidden red flags.
* Identify and correct revenue leakage through pipeline audits and scoreboard analysis.
* Own forecasting accuracy and ensure Sales Directors can always speak to revenue projections.

**Qualitative Sales Management & Enablement**

* Audit Sales Director management trackers daily, including call reviews, rep development logs, objections, FAQs, and insights.
* Review call analyses completed by Sales Directors and provide direct feedback on coaching quality and focus.
* Identify trends across brands to inform training topics, talk track improvements, and sales material needs.

**Training, Sales Engineering & One-to-Many Enablement**

* Own all company-wide sales training and curriculum.
* Ensure training content is up to date and aligned with core revenue-driving levers.
* Create and deliver recurring company-wide trainings.
* Drive sales engineering initiatives including pitch improvements, objection frameworks, closing decks, and supporting sales materials.

**Capacity Planning & Cross-Functional Alignment**

* Ensure all brands are staffed to capacity and hiring demand is clearly communicated.
* Act as the primary bridge between Sales Directors and Talent Acquisition.
* Partner with Marketing on lead flow, funnel health, and performance feedback.
* Collaborate with leadership on account growth, scaling initiatives, and strategic priorities.

### **What Success Looks Like (First 12 Months)**

* Sales Directors operate autonomously with clear accountability and strong decision-making.
* Revenue forecasts are accurate, visible, and trusted by leadership.
* Minimal revenue leakage across pipelines and funnels.
* Consistent month-over-month growth driven by scalable systems, not heroics.
* A sales organization that performs at a high level without executive micromanagement.

**Bottom line:** This role is for a true sales operator who wants full ownership of revenue execution through people, process, and data. If you know how to scale sales by building elite managers—and you want the scoreboard to prove it—this is your seat.

WFS is a high performance RevOps agency that installs and deploys enterprise-grade, AI-driven revenue engines and selling systems for our clients. Think of a lead generation based marketing agency…. But focused on sales Put simply, our clients outsource their sales department to us and we sell their services to help them scale faster than ever before while changing as many people’s lives as possible. We architect entire end-to-end sales solutions by designing custom sales motions, integrating battle-tested systems, developing go to market strategies powered by our proprietary playbooks, and then hiring, training, and managing a highly trained on demand sales force to deploy faster and more predictable revenue engines. The current verticals we serve are the alternative education space that sell transformative programs including everything from business consulting programs, to programs that teach people how to invest in real estate, learn mergers and acquisitions and many many more, along with the software as a service (SaaS) vertical, bringing cutting edge technology products to market. In short, we’re a full-stack RevOps implementation partner that installs full cycle turnkey selling systems for our clients.

### **Position Overview**

The Vice President of Sales is the most leveraged revenue operator at WFS. This role exists to scale sales performance through managers, not by closing deals personally. The VP of Sales owns the entire sales management motion and is accountable for the results produced by Sales Directors and their teams across all brands.

As WFS scales, the hardest problem to solve is scaling decision-making. This role ensures that Sales Directors are trained, coached, and audited to make the same decisions leadership would make—without constant escalation. Your success is measured by the distance between executive leadership and day-to-day sales operations: when the system works, leadership doesn’t need to be in the weeds.

This is a highly operational, execution-first role. You will own onboarding and integration of new accounts, audit qualitative and quantitative management daily, design how offers are sold, prevent revenue leakage, and deliver company-wide sales training. You are both the architect and auditor of how revenue is generated at scale.

### **You SHOULD apply if…**

* You have led multi-team, multi-brand sales organizations through managers (Sales Directors, not just reps).
* You are exceptional at managing managers and holding leaders accountable to outcomes, not activity theater.
* You are fluent in CRMs, pipeline dashboards, scoreboards, and activity reports and use them daily.
* You can quickly identify revenue leakage, diagnose the root cause, and implement corrective action.
* You are confident making hiring, firing, and development decisions using performance data and clear standards.
* You enjoy building sales training, enablement, talk tracks, and pitch frameworks at scale.
* You can own onboarding and integration of new accounts without chaos, confusion, or dropped balls.
* You are calm under pressure and decisive when revenue is on the line.
* You naturally think in systems, leverage, and repeatability.
* You want real ownership of outcomes—not just influence without accountability.

### **You SHOULD NOT apply if…**

* You want to be a hands-on closer rather than a manager of managers.
* You have never directly owned revenue forecasting and pipeline health.
* You avoid difficult performance conversations or hesitate to terminate low performers.
* You prefer strategy decks, vision docs, or brainstorming over execution and inspection.
* You rely on intuition, vibes, or anecdotes instead of data to make decisions.
* You struggle to stay organized across multiple brands, priorities, and teams.
* You need consensus before taking ownership or making decisions.
* You are uncomfortable operating in a high-velocity, high-accountability environment.
* You want autonomy without visibility or accountability.

### **Major Roles & Responsibilities**

**Sales Leadership & Manager Accountability**

* Own the performance of all Sales Directors and the results produced by their teams.
* Audit and enforce all sales management activity KPIs on a weekly basis.
* Review scoreboards weekly with Sales Directors to identify trends, underperformance, and required personnel decisions.
* Ensure Sales Directors are making effective hiring, firing, and development decisions to maximize rep performance.

**Onboarding, Integration & Sales Motion Ownership**

* Take full ownership of sales decisions during onboarding and integration of new accounts.
* Lead integration calls related to staffing, compensation plans, and sales motion design.
* Design and refine pitch frameworks and talk tracks for new offers and brands.
* Ensure all new sales engines are launched with the correct funnels and go-to-market strategy.

**Pipeline, Forecasting & Revenue Leakage Prevention**

* Audit pipeline management reports and CRM activity logs daily across all brands.
* Ensure dashboards, reports, and activity indicators remain healthy with no hidden red flags.
* Identify and correct revenue leakage through pipeline audits and scoreboard analysis.
* Own forecasting accuracy and ensure Sales Directors can always speak to revenue projections.

**Qualitative Sales Management & Enablement**

* Audit Sales Director management trackers daily, including call reviews, rep development logs, objections, FAQs, and insights.
* Review call analyses completed by Sales Directors and provide direct feedback on coaching quality and focus.
* Identify trends across brands to inform training topics, talk track improvements, and sales material needs.

**Training, Sales Engineering & One-to-Many Enablement**

* Own all company-wide sales training and curriculum.
* Ensure training content is up to date and aligned with core revenue-driving levers.
* Create and deliver recurring company-wide trainings.
* Drive sales engineering initiatives including pitch improvements, objection frameworks, closing decks, and supporting sales materials.

**Capacity Planning & Cross-Functional Alignment**

* Ensure all brands are staffed to capacity and hiring demand is clearly communicated.
* Act as the primary bridge between Sales Directors and Talent Acquisition.
* Partner with Marketing on lead flow, funnel health, and performance feedback.
* Collaborate with leadership on account growth, scaling initiatives, and strategic priorities.

### **What Success Looks Like (First 12 Months)**

* Sales Directors operate autonomously with clear accountability and strong decision-making.
* Revenue forecasts are accurate, visible, and trusted by leadership.
* Minimal revenue leakage across pipelines and funnels.
* Consistent month-over-month growth driven by scalable systems, not heroics.
* A sales organization that performs at a high level without executive micromanagement.

**Bottom line:** This role is for a true sales operator who wants full ownership of revenue execution through people, process, and data. If you know how to scale sales by building elite managers—and you want the scoreboard to prove it—this is your seat.

**Capacity Planning & Cross-Functional Alignment**

* Ensure all brands are staffed to capacity and hiring demand is clearly communicated.
* Act as the primary bridge between Sales Directors and Talent Acquisition.
* Partner with Marketing on lead flow, funnel health, and performance feedback.
* Collaborate with leadership on account growth, scaling initiatives, and strategic priorities.

### **What Success Looks Like (First 12 Months)**

* Sales Directors operate autonomously with clear accountability and strong decision-making.
* Revenue forecasts are accurate, visible, and trusted by leadership.
* Minimal revenue leakage across pipelines and funnels.
* Consistent month-over-month growth driven by scalable systems, not heroics.
* A sales organization that performs at a high level without executive micromanagement.

**Bottom line:** This role is for a true sales operator who wants full ownership of revenue execution through people, process, and data. If you know how to scale sales by building elite managers—and you want the scoreboard to prove it—this is your seat.

WFS is a high performance RevOps agency that installs and deploys enterprise-grade, AI-driven revenue engines and selling systems for our clients. Think of a lead generation based marketing agency…. But focused on sales Put simply, our clients outsource their sales department to us and we sell their services to help them scale faster than ever before while changing as many people’s lives as possible. We architect entire end-to-end sales solutions by designing custom sales motions, integrating battle-tested systems, developing go to market strategies powered by our proprietary playbooks, and then hiring, training, and managing a highly trained on demand sales force to deploy faster and more predictable revenue engines. The current verticals we serve are the alternative education space that sell transformative programs including everything from business consulting programs, to programs that teach people how to invest in real estate, learn mergers and acquisitions and many many more, along with the software as a service (SaaS) vertical, bringing cutting edge technology products to market. In short, we’re a full-stack RevOps implementation partner that installs full cycle turnkey selling systems for our clients.

### **Position Overview**

The Vice President of Sales is the most leveraged revenue operator at WFS. This role exists to scale sales performance through managers, not by closing deals personally. The VP of Sales owns the entire sales management motion and is accountable for the results produced by Sales Directors and their teams across all brands.

As WFS scales, the hardest problem to solve is scaling decision-making. This role ensures that Sales Directors are trained, coached, and audited to make the same decisions leadership would make—without constant escalation. Your success is measured by the distance between executive leadership and day-to-day sales operations: when the system works, leadership doesn’t need to be in the weeds.

This is a highly operational, execution-first role. You will own onboarding and integration of new accounts, audit qualitative and quantitative management daily, design how offers are sold, prevent revenue leakage, and deliver company-wide sales training. You are both the architect and auditor of how revenue is generated at scale.

### **You SHOULD apply if…**

* You have led multi-team, multi-brand sales organizations through managers (Sales Directors, not just reps).
* You are exceptional at managing managers and holding leaders accountable to outcomes, not activity theater.
* You are fluent in CRMs, pipeline dashboards, scoreboards, and activity reports and use them daily.
* You can quickly identify revenue leakage, diagnose the root cause, and implement corrective action.
* You are confident making hiring, firing, and development decisions using performance data and clear standards.
* You enjoy building sales training, enablement, talk tracks, and pitch frameworks at scale.
* You can own onboarding and integration of new accounts without chaos, confusion, or dropped balls.
* You are calm under pressure and decisive when revenue is on the line.
* You naturally think in systems, leverage, and repeatability.
* You want real ownership of outcomes—not just influence without accountability.

### **You SHOULD NOT apply if…**

* You want to be a hands-on closer rather than a manager of managers.
* You have never directly owned revenue forecasting and pipeline health.
* You avoid difficult performance conversations or hesitate to terminate low performers.
* You prefer strategy decks, vision docs, or brainstorming over execution and inspection.
* You rely on intuition, vibes, or anecdotes instead of data to make decisions.
* You struggle to stay organized across multiple brands, priorities, and teams.
* You need consensus before taking ownership or making decisions.
* You are uncomfortable operating in a high-velocity, high-accountability environment.
* You want autonomy without visibility or accountability.

### **Major Roles & Responsibilities**

WFS is a high performance RevOps agency that installs and deploys enterprise-grade, AI-driven revenue engines and selling systems for our clients. Think of a lead generation based marketing agency…. But focused on sales Put simply, our clients outsource their sales department to us and we sell their services to help them scale faster than ever before while changing as many people’s lives as possible. We architect entire end-to-end sales solutions by designing custom sales motions, integrating battle-tested systems, developing go to market strategies powered by our proprietary playbooks, and then hiring, training, and managing a highly trained on demand sales force to deploy faster and more predictable revenue engines. The current verticals we serve are the alternative education space that sell transformative programs including everything from business consulting programs, to programs that teach people how to invest in real estate, learn mergers and acquisitions and many many more, along with the software as a service (SaaS) vertical, bringing cutting edge technology products to market. In short, we’re a full-stack RevOps implementation partner that installs full cycle turnkey selling systems for our clients.

### **Position Overview**

The Vice President of Sales is the most leveraged revenue operator at WFS. This role exists to scale sales performance through managers, not by closing deals personally. The VP of Sales owns the entire sales management motion and is accountable for the results produced by Sales Directors and their teams across all brands.

As WFS scales, the hardest problem to solve is scaling decision-making. This role ensures that Sales Directors are trained, coached, and audited to make the same decisions leadership would make—without constant escalation. Your success is measured by the distance between executive leadership and day-to-day sales operations: when the system works, leadership doesn’t need to be in the weeds.

This is a highly operational, execution-first role. You will own onboarding and integration of new accounts, audit qualitative and quantitative management daily, design how offers are sold, prevent revenue leakage, and deliver company-wide sales training. You are both the architect and auditor of how revenue is generated at scale.

### **You SHOULD apply if…**

* You have led multi-team, multi-brand sales organizations through managers (Sales Directors, not just reps).
* You are exceptional at managing managers and holding leaders accountable to outcomes, not activity theater.
* You are fluent in CRMs, pipeline dashboards, scoreboards, and activity reports and use them daily.
* You can quickly identify revenue leakage, diagnose the root cause, and implement corrective action.
* You are confident making hiring, firing, and development decisions using performance data and clear standards.
* You enjoy building sales training, enablement, talk tracks, and pitch frameworks at scale.
* You can own onboarding and integration of new accounts without chaos, confusion, or dropped balls.
* You are calm under pressure and decisive when revenue is on the line.
* You naturally think in systems, leverage, and repeatability.
* You want real ownership of outcomes—not just influence without accountability.

### **You SHOULD NOT apply if…**

* You want to be a hands-on closer rather than a manager of managers.
* You have never directly owned revenue forecasting and pipeline health.
* You avoid difficult performance conversations or hesitate to terminate low performers.
* You prefer strategy decks, vision docs, or brainstorming over execution and inspection.
* You rely on intuition, vibes, or anecdotes instead of data to make decisions.
* You struggle to stay organized across multiple brands, priorities, and teams.
* You need consensus before taking ownership or making decisions.
* You are uncomfortable operating in a high-velocity, high-accountability environment.
* You want autonomy without visibility or accountability.

WFS is a high performance RevOps agency that installs and deploys enterprise-grade, AI-driven revenue engines and selling systems for our clients. Think of a lead generation based marketing agency…. But focused on sales Put simply, our clients outsource their sales department to us and we sell their services to help them scale faster than ever before while changing as many people’s lives as possible. We architect entire end-to-end sales solutions by designing custom sales motions, integrating battle-tested systems, developing go to market strategies powered by our proprietary playbooks, and then hiring, training, and managing a highly trained on demand sales force to deploy faster and more predictable revenue engines. The current verticals we serve are the alternative education space that sell transformative programs including everything from business consulting programs, to programs that teach people how to invest in real estate, learn mergers and acquisitions and many many more, along with the software as a service (SaaS) vertical, bringing cutting edge technology products to market. In short, we’re a full-stack RevOps implementation partner that installs full cycle turnkey selling systems for our clients.

### **Position Overview**

The Vice President of Sales is the most leveraged revenue operator at WFS. This role exists to scale sales performance through managers, not by closing deals personally. The VP of Sales owns the entire sales management motion and is accountable for the results produced by Sales Directors and their teams across all brands.

As WFS scales, the hardest problem to solve is scaling decision-making. This role ensures that Sales Directors are trained, coached, and audited to make the same decisions leadership would make—without constant escalation. Your success is measured by the distance between executive leadership and day-to-day sales operations: when the system works, leadership doesn’t need to be in the weeds.

This is a highly operational, execution-first role. You will own onboarding and integration of new accounts, audit qualitative and quantitative management daily, design how offers are sold, prevent revenue leakage, and deliver company-wide sales training. You are both the architect and auditor of how revenue is generated at scale.

In short, we’re a full-stack RevOps implementation partner that installs full cycle turnkey selling systems for our clients.

### **Position Overview**

The Vice President of Sales is the most leveraged revenue operator at WFS. This role exists to scale sales performance through managers, not by closing deals personally. The VP of Sales owns the entire sales management motion and is accountable for the results produced by Sales Directors and their teams across all brands.

As WFS scales, the hardest problem to solve is scaling decision-making. This role ensures that Sales Directors are trained, coached, and audited to make the same decisions leadership would make—without constant escalation. Your success is measured by the distance between executive leadership and day-to-day sales operations: when the system works, leadership doesn’t need to be in the weeds.

This is a highly operational, execution-first role. You will own onboarding and integration of new accounts, audit qualitative and quantitative management daily, design how offers are sold, prevent revenue leakage, and deliver company-wide sales training. You are both the architect and auditor of how revenue is generated at scale.

### **You SHOULD apply if…**

* You have led multi-team, multi-brand sales organizations through managers (Sales Directors, not just reps).
* You are exceptional at managing managers and holding leaders accountable to outcomes, not activity theater.
* You are fluent in CRMs, pipeline dashboards, scoreboards, and activity reports and use them daily.
* You can quickly identify revenue leakage, diagnose the root cause, and implement corrective action.
* You are confident making hiring, firing, and development decisions using performance data and clear standards.
* You enjoy building sales training, enablement, talk tracks, and pitch frameworks at scale.
* You can own onboarding and integration of new accounts without chaos, confusion, or dropped balls.
* You are calm under pressure and decisive when revenue is on the line.
* You naturally think in systems, leverage, and repeatability.
* You want real ownership of outcomes—not just influence without accountability.

### **You SHOULD NOT apply if…**

* You want to be a hands-on closer rather than a manager of managers.
* You have never directly owned revenue forecasting and pipeline health.
* You avoid difficult performance conversations or hesitate to terminate low performers.
* You prefer strategy decks, vision docs, or brainstorming over execution and inspection.
* You rely on intuition, vibes, or anecdotes instead of data to make decisions.
* You struggle to stay organized across multiple brands, priorities, and teams.
* You need consensus before taking ownership or making decisions.
* You are uncomfortable operating in a high-velocity, high-accountability environment.
* You want autonomy without visibility or accountability.

### **Major Roles & Responsibilities**

**Sales Leadership & Manager Accountability**

* Own the performance of all Sales Directors and the results produced by their teams.
* Audit and enforce all sales management activity KPIs on a weekly basis.
* Review scoreboards weekly with Sales Directors to identify trends, underperformance, and required personnel decisions.
* Ensure Sales Directors are making effective hiring, firing, and development decisions to maximize rep performance.

**Onboarding, Integration & Sales Motion Ownership**

* Take full ownership of sales decisions during onboarding and integration of new accounts.
* Lead integration calls related to staffing, compensation plans, and sales motion design.
* Design and refine pitch frameworks and talk tracks for new offers and brands.
* Ensure all new sales engines are launched with the correct funnels and go-to-market strategy.

**Pipeline, Forecasting & Revenue Leakage Prevention**

* Audit pipeline management reports and CRM activity logs daily across all brands.
* Ensure dashboards, reports, and activity indicators remain healthy with no hidden red flags.
* Identify and correct revenue leakage through pipeline audits and scoreboard analysis.
* Own forecasting accuracy and ensure Sales Directors can always speak to revenue projections.

**Qualitative Sales Management & Enablement**

* Audit Sales Director management trackers daily, including call reviews, rep development logs, objections, FAQs, and insights.
* Review call analyses completed by Sales Directors and provide direct feedback on coaching quality and focus.
* Identify trends across brands to inform training topics, talk track improvements, and sales material needs.

**Training, Sales Engineering & One-to-Many Enablement**

* Own all company-wide sales training and curriculum.
* Ensure training content is up to date and aligned with core revenue-driving levers.
* Create and deliver recurring company-wide trainings.
* Drive sales engineering initiatives including pitch improvements, objection frameworks, closing decks, and supporting sales materials.

**Capacity Planning & Cross-Functional Alignment**

* Ensure all brands are staffed to capacity and hiring demand is clearly communicated.
* Act as the primary bridge between Sales Directors and Talent Acquisition.
* Partner with Marketing on lead flow, funnel health, and performance feedback.
* Collaborate with leadership on account growth, scaling initiatives, and strategic priorities.

### **What Success Looks Like (First 12 Months)**

* Sales Directors operate autonomously with clear accountability and strong decision-making.
* Revenue forecasts are accurate, visible, and trusted by leadership.
* Minimal revenue leakage across pipelines and funnels.
* Consistent month-over-month growth driven by scalable systems, not heroics.
* A sales organization that performs at a high level without executive micromanagement.

**Bottom line:** This role is for a true sales operator who wants full ownership of revenue execution through people, process, and data. If you know how to scale sales by building elite managers—and you want the scoreboard to prove it—this is your seat.

WFS is a high performance RevOps agency that installs and deploys enterprise-grade, AI-driven revenue engines and selling systems for our clients. Think of a lead generation based marketing agency…. But focused on sales Put simply, our clients outsource their sales department to us and we sell their services to help them scale faster than ever before while changing as many people’s lives as possible. We architect entire end-to-end sales solutions by designing custom sales motions, integrating battle-tested systems, developing go to market strategies powered by our proprietary playbooks, and then hiring, training, and managing a highly trained on demand sales force to deploy faster and more predictable revenue engines. The current verticals we serve are the alternative education space that sell transformative programs including everything from business consulting programs, to programs that teach people how to invest in real estate, learn mergers and acquisitions and many many more, along with the software as a service (SaaS) vertical, bringing cutting edge technology products to market. In short, we’re a full-stack RevOps implementation partner that installs full cycle turnkey selling systems for our clients.

### **Position Overview**

The Vice President of Sales is the most leveraged revenue operator at WFS. This role exists to scale sales performance through managers, not by closing deals personally. The VP of Sales owns the entire sales management motion and is accountable for the results produced by Sales Directors and their teams across all brands.

As WFS scales, the hardest problem to solve is scaling decision-making. This role ensures that Sales Directors are trained, coached, and audited to make the same decisions leadership would make—without constant escalation. Your success is measured by the distance between executive leadership and day-to-day sales operations: when the system works, leadership doesn’t need to be in the weeds.

This is a highly operational, execution-first role. You will own onboarding and integration of new accounts, audit qualitative and quantitative management daily, design how offers are sold, prevent revenue leakage, and deliver company-wide sales training. You are both the architect and auditor of how revenue is generated at scale.

### **You SHOULD apply if…**

* You have led multi-team, multi-brand sales organizations through managers (Sales Directors, not just reps).
* You are exceptional at managing managers and holding leaders accountable to outcomes, not activity theater.
* You are fluent in CRMs, pipeline dashboards, scoreboards, and activity reports and use them daily.
* You can quickly identify revenue leakage, diagnose the root cause, and implement corrective action.
* You are confident making hiring, firing, and development decisions using performance data and clear standards.
* You enjoy building sales training, enablement, talk tracks, and pitch frameworks at scale.
* You can own onboarding and integration of new accounts without chaos, confusion, or dropped balls.
* You are calm under pressure and decisive when revenue is on the line.
* You naturally think in systems, leverage, and repeatability.
* You want real ownership of outcomes—not just influence without accountability.

### **You SHOULD NOT apply if…**

* You want to be a hands-on closer rather than a manager of managers.
* You have never directly owned revenue forecasting and pipeline health.
* You avoid difficult performance conversations or hesitate to terminate low performers.
* You prefer strategy decks, vision docs, or brainstorming over execution and inspection.
* You rely on intuition, vibes, or anecdotes instead of data to make decisions.
* You struggle to stay organized across multiple brands, priorities, and teams.
* You need consensus before taking ownership or making decisions.
* You are uncomfortable operating in a high-velocity, high-accountability environment.
* You want autonomy without visibility or accountability.

### **Major Roles & Responsibilities**

**Sales Leadership & Manager Accountability**

* Own the performance of all Sales Directors and the results produced by their teams.
* Audit and enforce all sales management activity KPIs on a weekly basis.
* Review scoreboards weekly with Sales Directors to identify trends, underperformance, and required personnel decisions.
* Ensure Sales Directors are making effective hiring, firing, and development decisions to maximize rep performance.

**Onboarding, Integration & Sales Motion Ownership**

* Take full ownership of sales decisions during onboarding and integration of new accounts.
* Lead integration calls related to staffing, compensation plans, and sales motion design.
* Design and refine pitch frameworks and talk tracks for new offers and brands.
* Ensure all new sales engines are launched with the correct funnels and go-to-market strategy.

**Pipeline, Forecasting & Revenue Leakage Prevention**

* Audit pipeline management reports and CRM activity logs daily across all brands.
* Ensure dashboards, reports, and activity indicators remain healthy with no hidden red flags.
* Identify and correct revenue leakage through pipeline audits and scoreboard analysis.
* Own forecasting accuracy and ensure Sales Directors can always speak to revenue projections.

**Qualitative Sales Management & Enablement**

* Audit Sales Director management trackers daily, including call reviews, rep development logs, objections, FAQs, and insights.
* Review call analyses completed by Sales Directors and provide direct feedback on coaching quality and focus.
* Identify trends across brands to inform training topics, talk track improvements, and sales material needs.

**Training, Sales Engineering & One-to-Many Enablement**

* Own all company-wide sales training and curriculum.
* Ensure training content is up to date and aligned with core revenue-driving levers.
* Create and deliver recurring company-wide trainings.
* Drive sales engineering initiatives including pitch improvements, objection frameworks, closing decks, and supporting sales materials.

**Capacity Planning & Cross-Functional Alignment**

* Ensure all brands are staffed to capacity and hiring demand is clearly communicated.
* Act as the primary bridge between Sales Directors and Talent Acquisition.
* Partner with Marketing on lead flow, funnel health, and performance feedback.
* Collaborate with leadership on account growth, scaling initiatives, and strategic priorities.

### **What Success Looks Like (First 12 Months)**

* Sales Directors operate autonomously with clear accountability and strong decision-making.
* Revenue forecasts are accurate, visible, and trusted by leadership.
* Minimal revenue leakage across pipelines and funnels.
* Consistent month-over-month growth driven by scalable systems, not heroics.
* A sales organization that performs at a high level without executive micromanagement.

**Bottom line:** This role is for a true sales operator who wants full ownership of revenue execution through people, process, and data. If you know how to scale sales by building elite managers—and you want the scoreboard to prove it—this is your seat.

Work Where It’s Best for You

Work Anywhere means you can work in an office or at home on any given day. It’s about getting the work done in the way and place that works best for each person. This applies across all locations and departments.

Work Anywhere does not mean work at any time. We have predictable core hours where employees are generally available for meetings and collaboration. Employees are focused and available during core hours.

We invest in our offices to make them places where our employees like to go. If you work in the office three or more days a week, you will have a dedicated office workspace. Our offices function as hubs to draw people in, create social bonds, and where random connections and mixing of ideas happen. We’re investing more in offices, culture, and offsite meetings, not less.

Product teams are organized in regional product hubs for optimal collaboration and live within a time zone of their hub. Our current product hubs are located in Pleasanton, Columbus, Boston, Kansas City, New York City, Raleigh, and Toronto. We create opportunities for teams to get together in person regularly.

Customer-facing roles, such as Sales and Professional Services, live near and/or travel to their customers.

When an employee moves within a country it does not cause a change in salary. Where you live impacts you and your family. Not knowing if your compensation will change if you move can cause stress and uncertainty for everyone. We wanted to eliminate that.

------------------------

Mimica's mission is to empower enterprises, teams, and individuals to reclaim their most precious resource — time and work more efficiently, with greater purpose and impact.

Our AI-powered task mining observes employee actions across the desktop and categorizes them into detailed process maps. Mimica’s process intelligence highlights inefficiencies, prioritizes improvements based on ROI, recommends the optimal technology for automation (RPA, intelligent document processing, GenAI), and provides a blueprint for building new automations and transforming work.

**Your Mission**
----------------

We’re looking for a hands-on VP of Sales to build, scale, and lead our enterprise revenue engine through our next phase of growth. This is a build-and-scale role for a sales leader ready to take ownership of the company’s next major revenue inflection point and help drive the business toward Series C readiness.

You will partner closely with our CEO and executive team to evolve our GTM motion, improve forecast accuracy, and scale a repeatable enterprise sales organization.

**Part of your day-to-day**
---------------------------

### **Sales Leadership & Revenue Ownership**

* Own enterprise revenue delivery as the company scales from ~$13M ARR toward ~$40M+ and Series C readiness.
* Operationalize a repeatable enterprise motion anchored in BDR-led outbound, events, strong discovery, and short, value-driven POCs.
* Step into complex, multi-stakeholder deals to reduce founder dependency across POCs, InfoSec, procurement, and negotiation.
* Tighten qualification standards to ensure executive alignment before POCs to improve velocity and win rates.

### **Pipeline, Forecasting & Operating Rigor**

* Build a forecasting cadence with clear stage criteria, probabilities, and early-warning indicators.
* Run disciplined deal and pipeline reviews focused on risk, buyer alignment, and next-step clarity.
* Improve predictability by identifying misses earlier and course-correcting within the quarter.
* Ensure CRM accuracy and pipeline coverage to support board-level and fundraising narratives.

### **Team Structure, Hiring & Coaching**

* Lead and develop the existing enterprise AE team, with hands-on coaching through long, complex cycles.
* Partner with the CEO on near-term quota, comp, and incentive adjustments to align cost of sale with growth targets.
* Prepare the org for the next hiring wave mid-year to support 2027 growth.

### **Enterprise Deal Strategy & Value Selling**

* Ensure consistent use of enterprise deal frameworks (e.g., MEDDIC, mutual close plans) without adding friction.
* Establish clear guidance on POCs, InfoSec sequencing, and executive sponsorship to shorten sales cycles.
* Enable reps to sell across transformation, business, and IT stakeholders with clarity on budget ownership.

### **Mid-Market & New Revenue Motions**

* Validate and scale the emerging mid-market motion as a lower-CAC, faster-payback complement to enterprise.
* Define ICP, enablement, and success criteria for expanding from one to multiple mid-market reps.
* Use mid-market performance to strengthen revenue mix, efficiency metrics, and Series C valuation story.

### **CEO Partnership & Strategic Judgment**

* Act as a true operating partner to the CEO, progressively taking ownership of deal execution and sales decisions.
* Help remove growth bottlenecks across pipeline efficiency, InfoSec friction, and deal velocity.
* Apply sound judgment in ambiguous enterprise scenarios, balancing speed, rigor, and long-term trust.
* Continuously diagnose gaps in the revenue engine and implement practical, scalable fixes.

**What you will bring**
-----------------------

* Deep enterprise sales execution and deal control; not just strategy.
* Strong consultative value seller with executive presence and financial acumen.

* Enable reps to sell across transformation, business, and IT stakeholders with clarity on budget ownership.

### **Mid-Market & New Revenue Motions**

### **CEO Partnership & Strategic Judgment**

* Apply sound judgment in ambiguous enterprise scenarios, balancing speed, rigor, and long-term trust.
