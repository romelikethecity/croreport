We’re scaling fast and looking for someone who can turn up the heat.

**The Role**

We’re hiring a CRO who can build and lead a global revenue machine. Not a caretaker, not an order taker. Not a strategist. A closer. A builder. A battlefield leader. Someone who thrives under pressure and knows how to hit targets, scale deals, and own the number.

**You’ll Be Responsible For:**

* Owning the entire revenue number — new logos, expansions, renewals, and vertical growth
* Building a high-output sales team in the USA and Canada.
* Closing large enterprise deals — $2M+ ARR, multi-location, multi-year
* Expanding wallet share in existing accounts through cross-sell/upsell
* Driving aggressive top-of-funnel activity and predictable pipeline velocity
* Developing and enforcing a clear GTM strategy by vertical (utilities, fintech, logistics, etc.)
* Enabling fast execution through clear metrics, quotas, and accountability
* Partnering tightly with delivery to sell what we can scale — and scale what we sell

**What We’re Looking For:**

* 10–15+ years in BPO sales leadership with a record of explosive growth
* Deep experience with complex sales, RFPs, and CX outsourcing contracts
* Track record of hiring, ramping, and holding sales teams accountable
* Hands-on dealmaker, not a backseat manager
* Obsessed with metrics, velocity, and quota discipline
* Confident, direct, and unshakable under pressure

**What Winning Looks Like in 12 Months**

* Revenue up 30 %+ YoY
* 3–5 enterprise logos signed with $10+ annual value
* The sales team is fully built and quota-carrying across all our regions.
* High win rate, short cycle times, predictable forecasting
* Clear vertical strategy driving measurable pipeline growth

The VP of Revenue Operations is responsible for building and leading an integrated revenue operations function that enables predictable and efficient growth across all go-to-market teams. The role aligns marketing, sales, technical success, and finance around a unified GTM strategy, standardized processes, and a single source of truth for revenue data, with particular focus on subscription / usage-based DevOps software metrics (ARR, NRR, expansion, churn). The ideal candidate has a proven track record of scaling B2B SaaS or DevOps revenue operations from under $50M to over $ 250M in ARR.

### **What You'll Do:**

* Partner with the CRO and executive team to define the multi‑year revenue strategy, including segmentation, coverage model, and capacity planning across direct, channel, and self‑serve motions.
* Lead the annual and quarterly GTM planning process: targets, territories, quotas, headcount plans, compensation design, and budget alignment across Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, and Partnerships.
* Develop and maintain a unified revenue performance framework (pipeline, conversion, cycle time, retention, expansion) to guide investment decisions and trade‑offs.
* Own the Revenue enablement program for all functions within the organization.
* Own end‑to‑end GTM process design from lead to renewal and expansion (lead management, qualification, opportunity management, deal desk, order management, handoffs to onboarding and CS, renewal playbooks).
* Standardize and continuously improve processes for different DevOps segments (e.g., PLG/self‑serve, mid‑market, enterprise, strategic accounts, MSPs/VARs) while preserving regional and segment flexibility where needed.
* Implement and govern clear operating cadences: QBRs, forecast calls, pipeline reviews, marketing performance reviews, and customer health reviews.
* Establish a single source of truth for revenue data across CRM, marketing automation, product telemetry, billing, and customer success platforms, with clear data definitions and governance.
* Build robust dashboards and analytics for pipeline health, forecast accuracy, cohort retention, product adoption, pricing/discounting, and sales productivity; turn insights into recommendations and action.
* Own the companywide revenue forecasting process (new, expansion, churn) and drive continuous improvements in accuracy, timeliness, and scenario modelling.
* Own the GTM tech stack strategy and roadmap (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot/Marketo, sales engagement, CPQ, CLM, CS platforms, data warehouse/BI, enrichment, routing, intent signals, PLG tooling).
* Ensure systems are designed and integrated to support DevOps‑specific motions such as trials, freemium, usage‑based pricing, marketplace transactions, and hybrid land‑and‑expand motions.
* Drive adoption, enablement, and change management for GTM tools, ensuring that teams use standardized workflows and that data quality remains high.
* Serve as the connective tissue between Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, Product, and Finance to ensure alignment on ICP, segmentation, messaging, pricing/packaging, and lifecycle plays.
* Partner with Product and Product Marketing to translate product telemetry and usage data into account‑level signals and plays (upsell, expansion, save, migration) for GTM teams.
* Oversee Revenue Enablement (directly or via dotted line), ensuring onboarding, ongoing training, and playbooks are grounded in data and aligned to GTM priorities.
* Build and lead a high‑performing RevOps organization spanning sales operations, marketing operations, CS operations, systems/administration, analytics, and deal desk.
* Define clear charters, operating models, and SLAs for how RevOps engages with GTM leaders and internal stakeholders.
* Develop talent, foster a culture of experimentation and continuous improvement, and position RevOps as a strategic partner rather than a reactive service function.

### **Your background:**

* 10–15+ years in revenue operations, sales operations, GTM strategy, or related fields, including leadership roles in high‑growth B2B SaaS; strong preference for DevOps, developer tools, or infrastructure software.
* Proven track record owning revenue operations for businesses with recurring/usage‑based models (ARR/NRR), with responsibility across marketing, sales, and CS.
* Deep experience with GTM planning and execution: segmentation, territory and quota design, capacity modelling, comp plan design, and forecasting at scale.
* Demonstrated success building and scaling RevOps or similar teams, including hiring managers and senior ICs across systems, analytics, and process.
* Expert‑level proficiency with modern GTM systems (CRM, marketing automation, sales engagement, CS tools, CPQ, BI, data warehouse) and their integration patterns.
* Strong analytical and financial skills; comfortable working with executives and board‑level stakeholders on metrics, forecasts, and trade‑off decisions.
* Excellent communication, influencing, and change‑management skills in a highly cross‑functional, often remote/distributed environment.
* Experience in a product‑led or hybrid PLG/enterprise motion is a strong plus, especially where product telemetry and marketplace channels are central to GTM.
