WFS is a high performance RevOps agency that installs and deploys enterprise-grade, AI-driven revenue engines and selling systems for our clients. Think of a lead generation based marketing agency…. But focused on sales Put simply, our clients outsource their sales department to us and we sell their services to help them scale faster than ever before while changing as many people’s lives as possible. We architect entire end-to-end sales solutions by designing custom sales motions, integrating battle-tested systems, developing go to market strategies powered by our proprietary playbooks, and then hiring, training, and managing a highly trained on demand sales force to deploy faster and more predictable revenue engines. The current verticals we serve are the alternative education space that sell transformative programs including everything from business consulting programs, to programs that teach people how to invest in real estate, learn mergers and acquisitions and many many more, along with the software as a service (SaaS) vertical, bringing cutting edge technology products to market. In short, we’re a full-stack RevOps implementation partner that installs full cycle turnkey selling systems for our clients.

### **Position Overview**

The Vice President of Sales is the most leveraged revenue operator at WFS. This role exists to scale sales performance through managers, not by closing deals personally. The VP of Sales owns the entire sales management motion and is accountable for the results produced by Sales Directors and their teams across all brands.

As WFS scales, the hardest problem to solve is scaling decision-making. This role ensures that Sales Directors are trained, coached, and audited to make the same decisions leadership would make—without constant escalation. Your success is measured by the distance between executive leadership and day-to-day sales operations: when the system works, leadership doesn’t need to be in the weeds.

This is a highly operational, execution-first role. You will own onboarding and integration of new accounts, audit qualitative and quantitative management daily, design how offers are sold, prevent revenue leakage, and deliver company-wide sales training. You are both the architect and auditor of how revenue is generated at scale.

### **You SHOULD apply if…**

* You have led multi-team, multi-brand sales organizations through managers (Sales Directors, not just reps).
* You are exceptional at managing managers and holding leaders accountable to outcomes, not activity theater.
* You are fluent in CRMs, pipeline dashboards, scoreboards, and activity reports and use them daily.
* You can quickly identify revenue leakage, diagnose the root cause, and implement corrective action.
* You are confident making hiring, firing, and development decisions using performance data and clear standards.
* You enjoy building sales training, enablement, talk tracks, and pitch frameworks at scale.
* You can own onboarding and integration of new accounts without chaos, confusion, or dropped balls.
* You are calm under pressure and decisive when revenue is on the line.
* You naturally think in systems, leverage, and repeatability.
* You want real ownership of outcomes—not just influence without accountability.

### **You SHOULD NOT apply if…**

* You want to be a hands-on closer rather than a manager of managers.
* You have never directly owned revenue forecasting and pipeline health.
* You avoid difficult performance conversations or hesitate to terminate low performers.
* You prefer strategy decks, vision docs, or brainstorming over execution and inspection.
* You rely on intuition, vibes, or anecdotes instead of data to make decisions.
* You struggle to stay organized across multiple brands, priorities, and teams.
* You need consensus before taking ownership or making decisions.
* You are uncomfortable operating in a high-velocity, high-accountability environment.
* You want autonomy without visibility or accountability.

### **Major Roles & Responsibilities**

**Sales Leadership & Manager Accountability**

* Own the performance of all Sales Directors and the results produced by their teams.
* Audit and enforce all sales management activity KPIs on a weekly basis.
* Review scoreboards weekly with Sales Directors to identify trends, underperformance, and required personnel decisions.
* Ensure Sales Directors are making effective hiring, firing, and development decisions to maximize rep performance.

**Onboarding, Integration & Sales Motion Ownership**

* Take full ownership of sales decisions during onboarding and integration of new accounts.
* Lead integration calls related to staffing, compensation plans, and sales motion design.
* Design and refine pitch frameworks and talk tracks for new offers and brands.
* Ensure all new sales engines are launched with the correct funnels and go-to-market strategy.

**Pipeline, Forecasting & Revenue Leakage Prevention**

* Audit pipeline management reports and CRM activity logs daily across all brands.
* Ensure dashboards, reports, and activity indicators remain healthy with no hidden red flags.
* Identify and correct revenue leakage through pipeline audits and scoreboard analysis.
* Own forecasting accuracy and ensure Sales Directors can always speak to revenue projections.

**Qualitative Sales Management & Enablement**

* Audit Sales Director management trackers daily, including call reviews, rep development logs, objections, FAQs, and insights.
* Review call analyses completed by Sales Directors and provide direct feedback on coaching quality and focus.
* Identify trends across brands to inform training topics, talk track improvements, and sales material needs.

**Training, Sales Engineering & One-to-Many Enablement**

* Own all company-wide sales training and curriculum.
* Ensure training content is up to date and aligned with core revenue-driving levers.
* Create and deliver recurring company-wide trainings.
* Drive sales engineering initiatives including pitch improvements, objection frameworks, closing decks, and supporting sales materials.

**Capacity Planning & Cross-Functional Alignment**

* Ensure all brands are staffed to capacity and hiring demand is clearly communicated.
* Act as the primary bridge between Sales Directors and Talent Acquisition.
* Partner with Marketing on lead flow, funnel health, and performance feedback.
* Collaborate with leadership on account growth, scaling initiatives, and strategic priorities.

### **What Success Looks Like (First 12 Months)**

* Sales Directors operate autonomously with clear accountability and strong decision-making.
* Revenue forecasts are accurate, visible, and trusted by leadership.
* Minimal revenue leakage across pipelines and funnels.
* Consistent month-over-month growth driven by scalable systems, not heroics.
* A sales organization that performs at a high level without executive micromanagement.

**Bottom line:** This role is for a true sales operator who wants full ownership of revenue execution through people, process, and data. If you know how to scale sales by building elite managers—and you want the scoreboard to prove it—this is your seat.

WFS is a high performance RevOps agency that installs and deploys enterprise-grade, AI-driven revenue engines and selling systems for our clients. Think of a lead generation based marketing agency…. But focused on sales Put simply, our clients outsource their sales department to us and we sell their services to help them scale faster than ever before while changing as many people’s lives as possible. We architect entire end-to-end sales solutions by designing custom sales motions, integrating battle-tested systems, developing go to market strategies powered by our proprietary playbooks, and then hiring, training, and managing a highly trained on demand sales force to deploy faster and more predictable revenue engines. The current verticals we serve are the alternative education space that sell transformative programs including everything from business consulting programs, to programs that teach people how to invest in real estate, learn mergers and acquisitions and many many more, along with the software as a service (SaaS) vertical, bringing cutting edge technology products to market. In short, we’re a full-stack RevOps implementation partner that installs full cycle turnkey selling systems for our clients.

### **Position Overview**

The Vice President of Sales is the most leveraged revenue operator at WFS. This role exists to scale sales performance through managers, not by closing deals personally. The VP of Sales owns the entire sales management motion and is accountable for the results produced by Sales Directors and their teams across all brands.

As WFS scales, the hardest problem to solve is scaling decision-making. This role ensures that Sales Directors are trained, coached, and audited to make the same decisions leadership would make—without constant escalation. Your success is measured by the distance between executive leadership and day-to-day sales operations: when the system works, leadership doesn’t need to be in the weeds.

This is a highly operational, execution-first role. You will own onboarding and integration of new accounts, audit qualitative and quantitative management daily, design how offers are sold, prevent revenue leakage, and deliver company-wide sales training. You are both the architect and auditor of how revenue is generated at scale.

### **You SHOULD apply if…**

* You have led multi-team, multi-brand sales organizations through managers (Sales Directors, not just reps).
* You are exceptional at managing managers and holding leaders accountable to outcomes, not activity theater.
* You are fluent in CRMs, pipeline dashboards, scoreboards, and activity reports and use them daily.
* You can quickly identify revenue leakage, diagnose the root cause, and implement corrective action.
* You are confident making hiring, firing, and development decisions using performance data and clear standards.
* You enjoy building sales training, enablement, talk tracks, and pitch frameworks at scale.
* You can own onboarding and integration of new accounts without chaos, confusion, or dropped balls.
* You are calm under pressure and decisive when revenue is on the line.
* You naturally think in systems, leverage, and repeatability.
* You want real ownership of outcomes—not just influence without accountability.

### **You SHOULD NOT apply if…**

* You want to be a hands-on closer rather than a manager of managers.
* You have never directly owned revenue forecasting and pipeline health.
* You avoid difficult performance conversations or hesitate to terminate low performers.
* You prefer strategy decks, vision docs, or brainstorming over execution and inspection.
* You rely on intuition, vibes, or anecdotes instead of data to make decisions.
* You struggle to stay organized across multiple brands, priorities, and teams.
* You need consensus before taking ownership or making decisions.
* You are uncomfortable operating in a high-velocity, high-accountability environment.
* You want autonomy without visibility or accountability.

### **Major Roles & Responsibilities**

WFS is a high performance RevOps agency that installs and deploys enterprise-grade, AI-driven revenue engines and selling systems for our clients. Think of a lead generation based marketing agency…. But focused on sales Put simply, our clients outsource their sales department to us and we sell their services to help them scale faster than ever before while changing as many people’s lives as possible. We architect entire end-to-end sales solutions by designing custom sales motions, integrating battle-tested systems, developing go to market strategies powered by our proprietary playbooks, and then hiring, training, and managing a highly trained on demand sales force to deploy faster and more predictable revenue engines. The current verticals we serve are the alternative education space that sell transformative programs including everything from business consulting programs, to programs that teach people how to invest in real estate, learn mergers and acquisitions and many many more, along with the software as a service (SaaS) vertical, bringing cutting edge technology products to market. In short, we’re a full-stack RevOps implementation partner that installs full cycle turnkey selling systems for our clients.

### **Position Overview**

The Vice President of Sales is the most leveraged revenue operator at WFS. This role exists to scale sales performance through managers, not by closing deals personally. The VP of Sales owns the entire sales management motion and is accountable for the results produced by Sales Directors and their teams across all brands.

As WFS scales, the hardest problem to solve is scaling decision-making. This role ensures that Sales Directors are trained, coached, and audited to make the same decisions leadership would make—without constant escalation. Your success is measured by the distance between executive leadership and day-to-day sales operations: when the system works, leadership doesn’t need to be in the weeds.

This is a highly operational, execution-first role. You will own onboarding and integration of new accounts, audit qualitative and quantitative management daily, design how offers are sold, prevent revenue leakage, and deliver company-wide sales training. You are both the architect and auditor of how revenue is generated at scale.

### **You SHOULD apply if…**

* You have led multi-team, multi-brand sales organizations through managers (Sales Directors, not just reps).
* You are exceptional at managing managers and holding leaders accountable to outcomes, not activity theater.
* You are fluent in CRMs, pipeline dashboards, scoreboards, and activity reports and use them daily.
* You can quickly identify revenue leakage, diagnose the root cause, and implement corrective action.
* You are confident making hiring, firing, and development decisions using performance data and clear standards.
* You enjoy building sales training, enablement, talk tracks, and pitch frameworks at scale.
* You can own onboarding and integration of new accounts without chaos, confusion, or dropped balls.
* You are calm under pressure and decisive when revenue is on the line.
* You naturally think in systems, leverage, and repeatability.
* You want real ownership of outcomes—not just influence without accountability.

### **You SHOULD NOT apply if…**

* You want to be a hands-on closer rather than a manager of managers.
* You have never directly owned revenue forecasting and pipeline health.
* You avoid difficult performance conversations or hesitate to terminate low performers.
* You prefer strategy decks, vision docs, or brainstorming over execution and inspection.
* You rely on intuition, vibes, or anecdotes instead of data to make decisions.
* You struggle to stay organized across multiple brands, priorities, and teams.
* You need consensus before taking ownership or making decisions.
* You are uncomfortable operating in a high-velocity, high-accountability environment.
* You want autonomy without visibility or accountability.

WFS is a high performance RevOps agency that installs and deploys enterprise-grade, AI-driven revenue engines and selling systems for our clients. Think of a lead generation based marketing agency…. But focused on sales Put simply, our clients outsource their sales department to us and we sell their services to help them scale faster than ever before while changing as many people’s lives as possible. We architect entire end-to-end sales solutions by designing custom sales motions, integrating battle-tested systems, developing go to market strategies powered by our proprietary playbooks, and then hiring, training, and managing a highly trained on demand sales force to deploy faster and more predictable revenue engines. The current verticals we serve are the alternative education space that sell transformative programs including everything from business consulting programs, to programs that teach people how to invest in real estate, learn mergers and acquisitions and many many more, along with the software as a service (SaaS) vertical, bringing cutting edge technology products to market. In short, we’re a full-stack RevOps implementation partner that installs full cycle turnkey selling systems for our clients.

### **Position Overview**

The Vice President of Sales is the most leveraged revenue operator at WFS. This role exists to scale sales performance through managers, not by closing deals personally. The VP of Sales owns the entire sales management motion and is accountable for the results produced by Sales Directors and their teams across all brands.

As WFS scales, the hardest problem to solve is scaling decision-making. This role ensures that Sales Directors are trained, coached, and audited to make the same decisions leadership would make—without constant escalation. Your success is measured by the distance between executive leadership and day-to-day sales operations: when the system works, leadership doesn’t need to be in the weeds.

This is a highly operational, execution-first role. You will own onboarding and integration of new accounts, audit qualitative and quantitative management daily, design how offers are sold, prevent revenue leakage, and deliver company-wide sales training. You are both the architect and auditor of how revenue is generated at scale.

### **You SHOULD apply if…**

* You have led multi-team, multi-brand sales organizations through managers (Sales Directors, not just reps).
* You are exceptional at managing managers and holding leaders accountable to outcomes, not activity theater.
* You are fluent in CRMs, pipeline dashboards, scoreboards, and activity reports and use them daily.
* You can quickly identify revenue leakage, diagnose the root cause, and implement corrective action.
* You are confident making hiring, firing, and development decisions using performance data and clear standards.
* You enjoy building sales training, enablement, talk tracks, and pitch frameworks at scale.
* You can own onboarding and integration of new accounts without chaos, confusion, or dropped balls.
* You are calm under pressure and decisive when revenue is on the line.
* You naturally think in systems, leverage, and repeatability.
* You want real ownership of outcomes—not just influence without accountability.

### **Position Overview**

The Vice President of Sales is the most leveraged revenue operator at WFS. This role exists to scale sales performance through managers, not by closing deals personally. The VP of Sales owns the entire sales management motion and is accountable for the results produced by Sales Directors and their teams across all brands.

As WFS scales, the hardest problem to solve is scaling decision-making. This role ensures that Sales Directors are trained, coached, and audited to make the same decisions leadership would make—without constant escalation. Your success is measured by the distance between executive leadership and day-to-day sales operations: when the system works, leadership doesn’t need to be in the weeds.

This is a highly operational, execution-first role. You will own onboarding and integration of new accounts, audit qualitative and quantitative management daily, design how offers are sold, prevent revenue leakage, and deliver company-wide sales training. You are both the architect and auditor of how revenue is generated at scale.

### **You SHOULD apply if…**

* You have led multi-team, multi-brand sales organizations through managers (Sales Directors, not just reps).
* You are exceptional at managing managers and holding leaders accountable to outcomes, not activity theater.
* You are fluent in CRMs, pipeline dashboards, scoreboards, and activity reports and use them daily.
* You can quickly identify revenue leakage, diagnose the root cause, and implement corrective action.
* You are confident making hiring, firing, and development decisions using performance data and clear standards.
* You enjoy building sales training, enablement, talk tracks, and pitch frameworks at scale.
* You can own onboarding and integration of new accounts without chaos, confusion, or dropped balls.
* You are calm under pressure and decisive when revenue is on the line.
* You naturally think in systems, leverage, and repeatability.
* You want real ownership of outcomes—not just influence without accountability.

### **You SHOULD NOT apply if…**

* You want to be a hands-on closer rather than a manager of managers.
* You have never directly owned revenue forecasting and pipeline health.
* You avoid difficult performance conversations or hesitate to terminate low performers.
* You prefer strategy decks, vision docs, or brainstorming over execution and inspection.
* You rely on intuition, vibes, or anecdotes instead of data to make decisions.
* You struggle to stay organized across multiple brands, priorities, and teams.
* You need consensus before taking ownership or making decisions.
* You are uncomfortable operating in a high-velocity, high-accountability environment.
* You want autonomy without visibility or accountability.

### **Major Roles & Responsibilities**

**Sales Leadership & Manager Accountability**

* Own the performance of all Sales Directors and the results produced by their teams.
* Audit and enforce all sales management activity KPIs on a weekly basis.
* Review scoreboards weekly with Sales Directors to identify trends, underperformance, and required personnel decisions.
* Ensure Sales Directors are making effective hiring, firing, and development decisions to maximize rep performance.

**Onboarding, Integration & Sales Motion Ownership**

* Take full ownership of sales decisions during onboarding and integration of new accounts.
* Lead integration calls related to staffing, compensation plans, and sales motion design.
* Design and refine pitch frameworks and talk tracks for new offers and brands.
* Ensure all new sales engines are launched with the correct funnels and go-to-market strategy.

**Pipeline, Forecasting & Revenue Leakage Prevention**

* Audit pipeline management reports and CRM activity logs daily across all brands.
* Ensure dashboards, reports, and activity indicators remain healthy with no hidden red flags.
* Identify and correct revenue leakage through pipeline audits and scoreboard analysis.
* Own forecasting accuracy and ensure Sales Directors can always speak to revenue projections.

**Qualitative Sales Management & Enablement**

* Audit Sales Director management trackers daily, including call reviews, rep development logs, objections, FAQs, and insights.
* Review call analyses completed by Sales Directors and provide direct feedback on coaching quality and focus.
* Identify trends across brands to inform training topics, talk track improvements, and sales material needs.

**Training, Sales Engineering & One-to-Many Enablement**

* Own all company-wide sales training and curriculum.
* Ensure training content is up to date and aligned with core revenue-driving levers.
* Create and deliver recurring company-wide trainings.
* Drive sales engineering initiatives including pitch improvements, objection frameworks, closing decks, and supporting sales materials.

**Capacity Planning & Cross-Functional Alignment**

* Ensure all brands are staffed to capacity and hiring demand is clearly communicated.
* Act as the primary bridge between Sales Directors and Talent Acquisition.
* Partner with Marketing on lead flow, funnel health, and performance feedback.
* Collaborate with leadership on account growth, scaling initiatives, and strategic priorities.

### **What Success Looks Like (First 12 Months)**

* Sales Directors operate autonomously with clear accountability and strong decision-making.
* Revenue forecasts are accurate, visible, and trusted by leadership.
* Minimal revenue leakage across pipelines and funnels.
* Consistent month-over-month growth driven by scalable systems, not heroics.
* A sales organization that performs at a high level without executive micromanagement.

**Bottom line:** This role is for a true sales operator who wants full ownership of revenue execution through people, process, and data. If you know how to scale sales by building elite managers—and you want the scoreboard to prove it—this is your seat.

WFS is a high performance RevOps agency that installs and deploys enterprise-grade, AI-driven revenue engines and selling systems for our clients. Think of a lead generation based marketing agency…. But focused on sales Put simply, our clients outsource their sales department to us and we sell their services to help them scale faster than ever before while changing as many people’s lives as possible. We architect entire end-to-end sales solutions by designing custom sales motions, integrating battle-tested systems, developing go to market strategies powered by our proprietary playbooks, and then hiring, training, and managing a highly trained on demand sales force to deploy faster and more predictable revenue engines. The current verticals we serve are the alternative education space that sell transformative programs including everything from business consulting programs, to programs that teach people how to invest in real estate, learn mergers and acquisitions and many many more, along with the software as a service (SaaS) vertical, bringing cutting edge technology products to market. In short, we’re a full-stack RevOps implementation partner that installs full cycle turnkey selling systems for our clients.

### **Position Overview**

The Vice President of Sales is the most leveraged revenue operator at WFS. This role exists to scale sales performance through managers, not by closing deals personally. The VP of Sales owns the entire sales management motion and is accountable for the results produced by Sales Directors and their teams across all brands.

As WFS scales, the hardest problem to solve is scaling decision-making. This role ensures that Sales Directors are trained, coached, and audited to make the same decisions leadership would make—without constant escalation. Your success is measured by the distance between executive leadership and day-to-day sales operations: when the system works, leadership doesn’t need to be in the weeds.

This is a highly operational, execution-first role. You will own onboarding and integration of new accounts, audit qualitative and quantitative management daily, design how offers are sold, prevent revenue leakage, and deliver company-wide sales training. You are both the architect and auditor of how revenue is generated at scale.

### **You SHOULD apply if…**

* You have led multi-team, multi-brand sales organizations through managers (Sales Directors, not just reps).
* You are exceptional at managing managers and holding leaders accountable to outcomes, not activity theater.
* You are fluent in CRMs, pipeline dashboards, scoreboards, and activity reports and use them daily.
* You can quickly identify revenue leakage, diagnose the root cause, and implement corrective action.
* You are confident making hiring, firing, and development decisions using performance data and clear standards.
* You enjoy building sales training, enablement, talk tracks, and pitch frameworks at scale.
* You can own onboarding and integration of new accounts without chaos, confusion, or dropped balls.
* You are calm under pressure and decisive when revenue is on the line.
* You naturally think in systems, leverage, and repeatability.
* You want real ownership of outcomes—not just influence without accountability.

### **You SHOULD NOT apply if…**

* You want to be a hands-on closer rather than a manager of managers.
* You have never directly owned revenue forecasting and pipeline health.
* You avoid difficult performance conversations or hesitate to terminate low performers.
* You prefer strategy decks, vision docs, or brainstorming over execution and inspection.
* You rely on intuition, vibes, or anecdotes instead of data to make decisions.
* You struggle to stay organized across multiple brands, priorities, and teams.
* You need consensus before taking ownership or making decisions.
* You are uncomfortable operating in a high-velocity, high-accountability environment.
* You want autonomy without visibility or accountability.

### **Major Roles & Responsibilities**

**Sales Leadership & Manager Accountability**

* Own the performance of all Sales Directors and the results produced by their teams.
* Audit and enforce all sales management activity KPIs on a weekly basis.
* Review scoreboards weekly with Sales Directors to identify trends, underperformance, and required personnel decisions.
* Ensure Sales Directors are making effective hiring, firing, and development decisions to maximize rep performance.

**Onboarding, Integration & Sales Motion Ownership**

* Take full ownership of sales decisions during onboarding and integration of new accounts.
* Lead integration calls related to staffing, compensation plans, and sales motion design.
* Design and refine pitch frameworks and talk tracks for new offers and brands.
* Ensure all new sales engines are launched with the correct funnels and go-to-market strategy.

**Pipeline, Forecasting & Revenue Leakage Prevention**

* Audit pipeline management reports and CRM activity logs daily across all brands.
* Ensure dashboards, reports, and activity indicators remain healthy with no hidden red flags.
* Identify and correct revenue leakage through pipeline audits and scoreboard analysis.
* Own forecasting accuracy and ensure Sales Directors can always speak to revenue projections.

**Qualitative Sales Management & Enablement**

* Audit Sales Director management trackers daily, including call reviews, rep development logs, objections, FAQs, and insights.
* Review call analyses completed by Sales Directors and provide direct feedback on coaching quality and focus.
* Identify trends across brands to inform training topics, talk track improvements, and sales material needs.

**Training, Sales Engineering & One-to-Many Enablement**

* Own all company-wide sales training and curriculum.
* Ensure training content is up to date and aligned with core revenue-driving levers.
* Create and deliver recurring company-wide trainings.
* Drive sales engineering initiatives including pitch improvements, objection frameworks, closing decks, and supporting sales materials.

**Capacity Planning & Cross-Functional Alignment**

* Ensure all brands are staffed to capacity and hiring demand is clearly communicated.
* Act as the primary bridge between Sales Directors and Talent Acquisition.
* Partner with Marketing on lead flow, funnel health, and performance feedback.
* Collaborate with leadership on account growth, scaling initiatives, and strategic priorities.

### **What Success Looks Like (First 12 Months)**

* Sales Directors operate autonomously with clear accountability and strong decision-making.
* Revenue forecasts are accurate, visible, and trusted by leadership.
* Minimal revenue leakage across pipelines and funnels.
* Consistent month-over-month growth driven by scalable systems, not heroics.
* A sales organization that performs at a high level without executive micromanagement.

**Bottom line:** This role is for a true sales operator who wants full ownership of revenue execution through people, process, and data. If you know how to scale sales by building elite managers—and you want the scoreboard to prove it—this is your seat.

WFS is a high performance RevOps agency that installs and deploys enterprise-grade, AI-driven revenue engines and selling systems for our clients. Think of a lead generation based marketing agency…. But focused on sales Put simply, our clients outsource their sales department to us and we sell their services to help them scale faster than ever before while changing as many people’s lives as possible. We architect entire end-to-end sales solutions by designing custom sales motions, integrating battle-tested systems, developing go to market strategies powered by our proprietary playbooks, and then hiring, training, and managing a highly trained on demand sales force to deploy faster and more predictable revenue engines. The current verticals we serve are the alternative education space that sell transformative programs including everything from business consulting programs, to programs that teach people how to invest in real estate, learn mergers and acquisitions and many many more, along with the software as a service (SaaS) vertical, bringing cutting edge technology products to market. In short, we’re a full-stack RevOps implementation partner that installs full cycle turnkey selling systems for our clients.

### **Position Overview**

The Vice President of Sales is the most leveraged revenue operator at WFS. This role exists to scale sales performance through managers, not by closing deals personally. The VP of Sales owns the entire sales management motion and is accountable for the results produced by Sales Directors and their teams across all brands.

As WFS scales, the hardest problem to solve is scaling decision-making. This role ensures that Sales Directors are trained, coached, and audited to make the same decisions leadership would make—without constant escalation. Your success is measured by the distance between executive leadership and day-to-day sales operations: when the system works, leadership doesn’t need to be in the weeds.

This is a highly operational, execution-first role. You will own onboarding and integration of new accounts, audit qualitative and quantitative management daily, design how offers are sold, prevent revenue leakage, and deliver company-wide sales training. You are both the architect and auditor of how revenue is generated at scale.

WFS is a high performance RevOps agency that installs and deploys enterprise-grade, AI-driven revenue engines and selling systems for our clients. Think of a lead generation based marketing agency…. But focused on sales Put simply, our clients outsource their sales department to us and we sell their services to help them scale faster than ever before while changing as many people’s lives as possible. We architect entire end-to-end sales solutions by designing custom sales motions, integrating battle-tested systems, developing go to market strategies powered by our proprietary playbooks, and then hiring, training, and managing a highly trained on demand sales force to deploy faster and more predictable revenue engines.

In short, we’re a full-stack RevOps implementation partner that installs full cycle turnkey selling systems for our clients.

### **Position Overview**

The Vice President of Sales is the most leveraged revenue operator at WFS. This role exists to scale sales performance through managers, not by closing deals personally. The VP of Sales owns the entire sales management motion and is accountable for the results produced by Sales Directors and their teams across all brands.

As WFS scales, the hardest problem to solve is scaling decision-making. This role ensures that Sales Directors are trained, coached, and audited to make the same decisions leadership would make—without constant escalation. Your success is measured by the distance between executive leadership and day-to-day sales operations: when the system works, leadership doesn’t need to be in the weeds.

This is a highly operational, execution-first role. You will own onboarding and integration of new accounts, audit qualitative and quantitative management daily, design how offers are sold, prevent revenue leakage, and deliver company-wide sales training. You are both the architect and auditor of how revenue is generated at scale.

### **You SHOULD apply if…**

* You have led multi-team, multi-brand sales organizations through managers (Sales Directors, not just reps).
* You are exceptional at managing managers and holding leaders accountable to outcomes, not activity theater.
* You are fluent in CRMs, pipeline dashboards, scoreboards, and activity reports and use them daily.
* You can quickly identify revenue leakage, diagnose the root cause, and implement corrective action.
* You are confident making hiring, firing, and development decisions using performance data and clear standards.
* You enjoy building sales training, enablement, talk tracks, and pitch frameworks at scale.
* You can own onboarding and integration of new accounts without chaos, confusion, or dropped balls.
* You are calm under pressure and decisive when revenue is on the line.
* You naturally think in systems, leverage, and repeatability.
* You want real ownership of outcomes—not just influence without accountability.

### **You SHOULD NOT apply if…**

* You want to be a hands-on closer rather than a manager of managers.
* You have never directly owned revenue forecasting and pipeline health.
* You avoid difficult performance conversations or hesitate to terminate low performers.
* You prefer strategy decks, vision docs, or brainstorming over execution and inspection.
* You rely on intuition, vibes, or anecdotes instead of data to make decisions.
* You struggle to stay organized across multiple brands, priorities, and teams.
* You need consensus before taking ownership or making decisions.
* You are uncomfortable operating in a high-velocity, high-accountability environment.
* You want autonomy without visibility or accountability.

### **Major Roles & Responsibilities**

**Sales Leadership & Manager Accountability**

* Own the performance of all Sales Directors and the results produced by their teams.
* Audit and enforce all sales management activity KPIs on a weekly basis.
* Review scoreboards weekly with Sales Directors to identify trends, underperformance, and required personnel decisions.

* Identify trends across brands to inform training topics, talk track improvements, and sales material needs.

**Training, Sales Engineering & One-to-Many Enablement**

* Own all company-wide sales training and curriculum.
* Ensure training content is up to date and aligned with core revenue-driving levers.
* Create and deliver recurring company-wide trainings.
* Drive sales engineering initiatives including pitch improvements, objection frameworks, closing decks, and supporting sales materials.

**Capacity Planning & Cross-Functional Alignment**

* Ensure all brands are staffed to capacity and hiring demand is clearly communicated.
* Act as the primary bridge between Sales Directors and Talent Acquisition.
* Partner with Marketing on lead flow, funnel health, and performance feedback.
* Collaborate with leadership on account growth, scaling initiatives, and strategic priorities.

### **What Success Looks Like (First 12 Months)**

* Sales Directors operate autonomously with clear accountability and strong decision-making.

### **Position Overview**

The Vice President of Sales is the most leveraged revenue operator at WFS. This role exists to scale sales performance through managers, not by closing deals personally. The VP of Sales owns the entire sales management motion and is accountable for the results produced by Sales Directors and their teams across all brands.

As WFS scales, the hardest problem to solve is scaling decision-making. This role ensures that Sales Directors are trained, coached, and audited to make the same decisions leadership would make—without constant escalation. Your success is measured by the distance between executive leadership and day-to-day sales operations: when the system works, leadership doesn’t need to be in the weeds.

This is a highly operational, execution-first role. You will own onboarding and integration of new accounts, audit qualitative and quantitative management daily, design how offers are sold, prevent revenue leakage, and deliver company-wide sales training. You are both the architect and auditor of how revenue is generated at scale.

### **You SHOULD apply if…**

* You have led multi-team, multi-brand sales organizations through managers (Sales Directors, not just reps).
* You are exceptional at managing managers and holding leaders accountable to outcomes, not activity theater.
* You are fluent in CRMs, pipeline dashboards, scoreboards, and activity reports and use them daily.
* You can quickly identify revenue leakage, diagnose the root cause, and implement corrective action.
* You are confident making hiring, firing, and development decisions using performance data and clear standards.
* You enjoy building sales training, enablement, talk tracks, and pitch frameworks at scale.
* You can own onboarding and integration of new accounts without chaos, confusion, or dropped balls.
* You are calm under pressure and decisive when revenue is on the line.
* You naturally think in systems, leverage, and repeatability.
* You want real ownership of outcomes—not just influence without accountability.

### **You SHOULD NOT apply if…**

* You want to be a hands-on closer rather than a manager of managers.
* You have never directly owned revenue forecasting and pipeline health.
* You avoid difficult performance conversations or hesitate to terminate low performers.
* You prefer strategy decks, vision docs, or brainstorming over execution and inspection.
* You rely on intuition, vibes, or anecdotes instead of data to make decisions.
* You struggle to stay organized across multiple brands, priorities, and teams.
* You need consensus before taking ownership or making decisions.
* You are uncomfortable operating in a high-velocity, high-accountability environment.
* You want autonomy without visibility or accountability.

### **Major Roles & Responsibilities**

**Sales Leadership & Manager Accountability**

* Own the performance of all Sales Directors and the results produced by their teams.
* Audit and enforce all sales management activity KPIs on a weekly basis.
* Review scoreboards weekly with Sales Directors to identify trends, underperformance, and required personnel decisions.
* Ensure Sales Directors are making effective hiring, firing, and development decisions to maximize rep performance.

**Onboarding, Integration & Sales Motion Ownership**

* Take full ownership of sales decisions during onboarding and integration of new accounts.
* Lead integration calls related to staffing, compensation plans, and sales motion design.
* Design and refine pitch frameworks and talk tracks for new offers and brands.
* Ensure all new sales engines are launched with the correct funnels and go-to-market strategy.

**Pipeline, Forecasting & Revenue Leakage Prevention**

* Audit pipeline management reports and CRM activity logs daily across all brands.
* Ensure dashboards, reports, and activity indicators remain healthy with no hidden red flags.
* Identify and correct revenue leakage through pipeline audits and scoreboard analysis.
* Own forecasting accuracy and ensure Sales Directors can always speak to revenue projections.

**Qualitative Sales Management & Enablement**

* Audit Sales Director management trackers daily, including call reviews, rep development logs, objections, FAQs, and insights.
* Review call analyses completed by Sales Directors and provide direct feedback on coaching quality and focus.
* Identify trends across brands to inform training topics, talk track improvements, and sales material needs.

**Training, Sales Engineering & One-to-Many Enablement**

* Own all company-wide sales training and curriculum.
* Ensure training content is up to date and aligned with core revenue-driving levers.
* Create and deliver recurring company-wide trainings.
* Drive sales engineering initiatives including pitch improvements, objection frameworks, closing decks, and supporting sales materials.

**Capacity Planning & Cross-Functional Alignment**

* Ensure all brands are staffed to capacity and hiring demand is clearly communicated.
* Act as the primary bridge between Sales Directors and Talent Acquisition.
* Partner with Marketing on lead flow, funnel health, and performance feedback.
* Collaborate with leadership on account growth, scaling initiatives, and strategic priorities.

### **What Success Looks Like (First 12 Months)**

* Sales Directors operate autonomously with clear accountability and strong decision-making.
* Revenue forecasts are accurate, visible, and trusted by leadership.
* Minimal revenue leakage across pipelines and funnels.
* Consistent month-over-month growth driven by scalable systems, not heroics.
* A sales organization that performs at a high level without executive micromanagement.

**Bottom line:** This role is for a true sales operator who wants full ownership of revenue execution through people, process, and data. If you know how to scale sales by building elite managers—and you want the scoreboard to prove it—this is your seat.

Regular

**Work Location:**

Client Support Center - Southlake, TX 76092

**Overview:**

**2020 Companies is now interviewing for a Vice President of Retail Sales**

**The Mission**

You aren't just managing a program; you are the chief architect of the partnership with our client and the cultural leader of our program. You will bridge the gap between strategy and retail execution, turning a complex, ever-changing retail environment into a high-performing sales engine for a global technology leader.

The Retail Sales Vice President is a senior-level role, focused on leading people, driving sales results, and providing exceptional client services. The ideal leader has proven experience creating a culture of excellence with internal partners, clients, retailers, and field teams. An ability to wear many hats and manage frequent program changes will be critical to success in this role, as you will serve as the single point of contact for our client’s leadership team and will act as the face of the 2020 brand in all aspects of the program.

As a client services leader, you will work closely with client personnel to ensure the program's overall success through daily communication, strategy collaboration, and program execution. The role will rely heavily on your ability to innovate, execute strategy, and drive sales results at retail. A key responsibility will be creating client- and executive-level presentations based on insights from retail reporting and your in-depth knowledge of industry trends; therefore, experience in consumer electronics is a plus. Your ability to translate ideas into recommended program initiatives and new strategies will be critical to client satisfaction. Having a servant-leader mentality, a relentless drive for continuous improvement, and the ability to connect remotely will be key to success in this role.

Our AI-powered task mining observes employee actions across the desktop and categorizes them into detailed process maps. Mimica’s process intelligence highlights inefficiencies, prioritizes improvements based on ROI, recommends the optimal technology for automation (RPA, intelligent document processing, GenAI), and provides a blueprint for building new automations and transforming work.

**Your Mission**
----------------

We’re looking for a hands-on VP of Sales to build, scale, and lead our enterprise revenue engine through our next phase of growth. This is a build-and-scale role for a sales leader ready to take ownership of the company’s next major revenue inflection point and help drive the business toward Series C readiness.

You will partner closely with our CEO and executive team to evolve our GTM motion, improve forecast accuracy, and scale a repeatable enterprise sales organization.

**Part of your day-to-day**
---------------------------

### **Sales Leadership & Revenue Ownership**

* Own enterprise revenue delivery as the company scales from ~$13M ARR toward ~$40M+ and Series C readiness.
* Operationalize a repeatable enterprise motion anchored in BDR-led outbound, events, strong discovery, and short, value-driven POCs.
* Step into complex, multi-stakeholder deals to reduce founder dependency across POCs, InfoSec, procurement, and negotiation.
* Tighten qualification standards to ensure executive alignment before POCs to improve velocity and win rates.

### **Pipeline, Forecasting & Operating Rigor**

* Build a forecasting cadence with clear stage criteria, probabilities, and early-warning indicators.
* Run disciplined deal and pipeline reviews focused on risk, buyer alignment, and next-step clarity.
* Improve predictability by identifying misses earlier and course-correcting within the quarter.
* Ensure CRM accuracy and pipeline coverage to support board-level and fundraising narratives.

### **Team Structure, Hiring & Coaching**

* Lead and develop the existing enterprise AE team, with hands-on coaching through long, complex cycles.
* Partner with the CEO on near-term quota, comp, and incentive adjustments to align cost of sale with growth targets.
* Prepare the org for the next hiring wave mid-year to support 2027 growth.

### **Enterprise Deal Strategy & Value Selling**

* Ensure consistent use of enterprise deal frameworks (e.g., MEDDIC, mutual close plans) without adding friction.
* Establish clear guidance on POCs, InfoSec sequencing, and executive sponsorship to shorten sales cycles.
* Enable reps to sell across transformation, business, and IT stakeholders with clarity on budget ownership.

### **Mid-Market & New Revenue Motions**

* Validate and scale the emerging mid-market motion as a lower-CAC, faster-payback complement to enterprise.
* Define ICP, enablement, and success criteria for expanding from one to multiple mid-market reps.
* Use mid-market performance to strengthen revenue mix, efficiency metrics, and Series C valuation story.

### **CEO Partnership & Strategic Judgment**

* Act as a true operating partner to the CEO, progressively taking ownership of deal execution and sales decisions.
* Help remove growth bottlenecks across pipeline efficiency, InfoSec friction, and deal velocity.
* Apply sound judgment in ambiguous enterprise scenarios, balancing speed, rigor, and long-term trust.
* Continuously diagnose gaps in the revenue engine and implement practical, scalable fixes.

**What you will bring**
-----------------------

* Deep enterprise sales execution and deal control; not just strategy.
* Strong consultative value seller with executive presence and financial acumen.
* Highly structured operator with disciplined pipeline and forecasting habits.
* Excellent hiring judgment and hands-on coach.

### **Pipeline, Forecasting & Operating Rigor**

* Lead and develop the existing enterprise AE team, with hands-on coaching through long, complex cycles.
* Partner with the CEO on near-term quota, comp, and incentive adjustments to align cost of sale with growth targets.

### **Enterprise Deal Strategy & Value Selling**

* Ensure consistent use of enterprise deal frameworks (e.g., MEDDIC, mutual close plans) without adding friction.

* Use mid-market performance to strengthen revenue mix, efficiency metrics, and Series C valuation story.

### **CEO Partnership & Strategic Judgment**

* Help remove growth bottlenecks across pipeline efficiency, InfoSec friction, and deal velocity.
* Apply sound judgment in ambiguous enterprise scenarios, balancing speed, rigor, and long-term trust.

* **Lead Sales Development (SDR/BDR) Strategy**
  + Manage the Sales Development organization responsible for creating a healthy, predictable pipeline of highly qualified opportunities.
  + Design warm outbound and inbound prospecting strategies, sequences, and qualification standards in partnership with Marketing.

  + Own sales KPIs, dashboards, and operating cadences using tools like Salesforce and analytics platforms.
  + Implement a rigorous rhythm of pipeline reviews, forecast calls, QBRs, and performance management.
  + Build a culture of accountability, coaching, and continuous improvement with clear expectations and transparent metrics.
* **Referral Channels**
  + Develop and execute referral channel strategies with building material suppliers, GCs, insurance brokers, bankers, and other key influencers to drive referrals and partner-generated revenue.
  + Collaborate with Marketing and Business Development on co-marketing, events, and programs to deepen ecosystem relationships.
* **Cross-Functional Leadership & Strategic Partner to the CEO**
  + Act as a critical thought partner to the CEO on new logo acquisition and revenue strategy, market selection, pricing, and portfolio mix.
  + Work closely with Product & Technology to relay structured feedback from prospects and customers, shaping product roadmap and go-to-market sequencing.

Its products, including the most widely used curriculum and assessment solutions, The Creative Curriculum and GOLD, reach over 4 million children each year in more than 80 countries around the world. A trusted partner and advocate for the early education community for 45 years, today Teaching Strategies connects teachers, children and families to inspired teaching and learning experiences, insightful data, stronger family partnerships, and robust professional learning through SmartTeach(TM), the leading early learning platform.

Work Where It’s Best for You

Work Anywhere means you can work in an office or at home on any given day. It’s about getting the work done in the way and place that works best for each person. This applies across all locations and departments.

Work Anywhere does not mean work at any time. We have predictable core hours where employees are generally available for meetings and collaboration. Employees are focused and available during core hours.

We invest in our offices to make them places where our employees like to go. If you work in the office three or more days a week, you will have a dedicated office workspace. Our offices function as hubs to draw people in, create social bonds, and where random connections and mixing of ideas happen. We’re investing more in offices, culture, and offsite meetings, not less.

Product teams are organized in regional product hubs for optimal collaboration and live within a time zone of their hub. Our current product hubs are located in Pleasanton, Columbus, Boston, Kansas City, New York City, Raleigh, and Toronto. We create opportunities for teams to get together in person regularly.

Customer-facing roles, such as Sales and Professional Services, live near and/or travel to their customers.

When an employee moves within a country it does not cause a change in salary. Where you live impacts you and your family. Not knowing if your compensation will change if you move can cause stress and uncertainty for everyone. We wanted to eliminate that.

Work at Veeva. Work where it’s best for you.",VP,

**Your Mission**
----------------

We’re looking for a hands-on VP of Sales to build, scale, and lead our enterprise revenue engine through our next phase of growth. This is a build-and-scale role for a sales leader ready to take ownership of the company’s next major revenue inflection point and help drive the business toward Series C readiness.

You will partner closely with our CEO and executive team to evolve our GTM motion, improve forecast accuracy, and scale a repeatable enterprise sales organization.

**Part of your day-to-day**
---------------------------

### **Sales Leadership & Revenue Ownership**

* Own enterprise revenue delivery as the company scales from ~$13M ARR toward ~$40M+ and Series C readiness.
* Operationalize a repeatable enterprise motion anchored in BDR-led outbound, events, strong discovery, and short, value-driven POCs.
* Step into complex, multi-stakeholder deals to reduce founder dependency across POCs, InfoSec, procurement, and negotiation.
* Tighten qualification standards to ensure executive alignment before POCs to improve velocity and win rates.

### **Pipeline, Forecasting & Operating Rigor**

* Build a forecasting cadence with clear stage criteria, probabilities, and early-warning indicators.
* Run disciplined deal and pipeline reviews focused on risk, buyer alignment, and next-step clarity.
* Improve predictability by identifying misses earlier and course-correcting within the quarter.
* Ensure CRM accuracy and pipeline coverage to support board-level and fundraising narratives.

### **Team Structure, Hiring & Coaching**

* Lead and develop the existing enterprise AE team, with hands-on coaching through long, complex cycles.
* Partner with the CEO on near-term quota, comp, and incentive adjustments to align cost of sale with growth targets.
* Prepare the org for the next hiring wave mid-year to support 2027 growth.

### **Enterprise Deal Strategy & Value Selling**

* Ensure consistent use of enterprise deal frameworks (e.g., MEDDIC, mutual close plans) without adding friction.
* Establish clear guidance on POCs, InfoSec sequencing, and executive sponsorship to shorten sales cycles.
* Enable reps to sell across transformation, business, and IT stakeholders with clarity on budget ownership.

### **Mid-Market & New Revenue Motions**

* Validate and scale the emerging mid-market motion as a lower-CAC, faster-payback complement to enterprise.
* Define ICP, enablement, and success criteria for expanding from one to multiple mid-market reps.
* Use mid-market performance to strengthen revenue mix, efficiency metrics, and Series C valuation story.

### **CEO Partnership & Strategic Judgment**

* Act as a true operating partner to the CEO, progressively taking ownership of deal execution and sales decisions.
* Help remove growth bottlenecks across pipeline efficiency, InfoSec friction, and deal velocity.
* Apply sound judgment in ambiguous enterprise scenarios, balancing speed, rigor, and long-term trust.
* Continuously diagnose gaps in the revenue engine and implement practical, scalable fixes.

**What you will bring**
-----------------------

* Deep enterprise sales execution and deal control; not just strategy.
* Strong consultative value seller with executive presence and financial acumen.
* Highly structured operator with disciplined pipeline and forecasting habits.
* Excellent hiring judgment and hands-on coach.
* Comfortable in ambiguity; decisive, pragmatic, and accountable.

* Use mid-market performance to strengthen revenue mix, efficiency metrics, and Series C valuation story.

### **CEO Partnership & Strategic Judgment**

* Act as a true operating partner to the CEO, progressively taking ownership of deal execution and sales decisions.
* Help remove growth bottlenecks across pipeline efficiency, InfoSec friction, and deal velocity.
* Apply sound judgment in ambiguous enterprise scenarios, balancing speed, rigor, and long-term trust.

------------------------

Mimica's mission is to empower enterprises, teams, and individuals to reclaim their most precious resource — time and work more efficiently, with greater purpose and impact.

Our AI-powered task mining observes employee actions across the desktop and categorizes them into detailed process maps. Mimica’s process intelligence highlights inefficiencies, prioritizes improvements based on ROI, recommends the optimal technology for automation (RPA, intelligent document processing, GenAI), and provides a blueprint for building new automations and transforming work.

**Your Mission**
----------------

We’re looking for a hands-on VP of Sales to build, scale, and lead our enterprise revenue engine through our next phase of growth. This is a build-and-scale role for a sales leader ready to take ownership of the company’s next major revenue inflection point and help drive the business toward Series C readiness.

You will partner closely with our CEO and executive team to evolve our GTM motion, improve forecast accuracy, and scale a repeatable enterprise sales organization.

**Part of your day-to-day**
---------------------------

### **Sales Leadership & Revenue Ownership**

* Own enterprise revenue delivery as the company scales from ~$13M ARR toward ~$40M+ and Series C readiness.
* Operationalize a repeatable enterprise motion anchored in BDR-led outbound, events, strong discovery, and short, value-driven POCs.
* Step into complex, multi-stakeholder deals to reduce founder dependency across POCs, InfoSec, procurement, and negotiation.
* Tighten qualification standards to ensure executive alignment before POCs to improve velocity and win rates.

### **Pipeline, Forecasting & Operating Rigor**

* Build a forecasting cadence with clear stage criteria, probabilities, and early-warning indicators.
* Run disciplined deal and pipeline reviews focused on risk, buyer alignment, and next-step clarity.
* Improve predictability by identifying misses earlier and course-correcting within the quarter.
* Ensure CRM accuracy and pipeline coverage to support board-level and fundraising narratives.

### **Team Structure, Hiring & Coaching**

* Lead and develop the existing enterprise AE team, with hands-on coaching through long, complex cycles.
* Partner with the CEO on near-term quota, comp, and incentive adjustments to align cost of sale with growth targets.
* Prepare the org for the next hiring wave mid-year to support 2027 growth.

### **Enterprise Deal Strategy & Value Selling**

* Ensure consistent use of enterprise deal frameworks (e.g., MEDDIC, mutual close plans) without adding friction.
* Establish clear guidance on POCs, InfoSec sequencing, and executive sponsorship to shorten sales cycles.
* Enable reps to sell across transformation, business, and IT stakeholders with clarity on budget ownership.

### **Mid-Market & New Revenue Motions**

* Validate and scale the emerging mid-market motion as a lower-CAC, faster-payback complement to enterprise.
* Define ICP, enablement, and success criteria for expanding from one to multiple mid-market reps.
* Use mid-market performance to strengthen revenue mix, efficiency metrics, and Series C valuation story.

### **CEO Partnership & Strategic Judgment**

* Act as a true operating partner to the CEO, progressively taking ownership of deal execution and sales decisions.
* Help remove growth bottlenecks across pipeline efficiency, InfoSec friction, and deal velocity.
* Apply sound judgment in ambiguous enterprise scenarios, balancing speed, rigor, and long-term trust.
* Continuously diagnose gaps in the revenue engine and implement practical, scalable fixes.

**What you will bring**
-----------------------

* Deep enterprise sales execution and deal control; not just strategy.
* Strong consultative value seller with executive presence and financial acumen.
* Highly structured operator with disciplined pipeline and forecasting habits.
* Excellent hiring judgment and hands-on coach.
* Comfortable in ambiguity; decisive, pragmatic, and accountable.
* Trusted cross-functional leader with strong communication and influence.
* Background working closely with product-led or technical founders.

The Vice President of Market Strategy and Commercialization is a senior leadership role reporting to the Chief Strategic Development Officer. This leader will be responsible for accelerating business velocity to reach our ambitious growth goals by leading and rotating across various top strategic priority areas over time. As a commercial operator and strategic builder, the VP of Market Strategy and Commercialization will combine deep market insights, hands-on go-to-market testing and refining, and end-to-end operating models to drive growth in unproven or emerging business lines. The role operates at the intersection of strategy and execution – acting as an internal “evangelist” to translate strategic opportunities into tangible commercial success across the organization.

The ideal candidate is a strategic thinker with strong business acumen and an entrepreneurial mindset, capable of driving strategy through execution in ambiguous, fast-paced environments. This leader should have a background as an operator or P&L leader, with a proven ability to lead cross-functional teams and deliver results on high-impact projects. This leader must be an exceptional communicator, able to influence at all levels and foster collaboration across departments. Just as importantly, the VP of Market Strategy and Commercialization should be aligned with our mission and passionate about wellness and healthcare, bringing a commitment to building solutions that empower people to lead healthier lives.

Primary responsibilities:

* Accountability for Emerging Business Lines or New Market Opportunities: Identify, launch, and drive key strategic priority markets that accelerate revenue growth and expand our impact. Operate as the business owner for these priority areas, from initial concept through full execution by serving as the central accountable figure – owning the strategy and P&L for these ventures to ensure they meet short-term and long-term performance goals. Think broadly about what the business line may need to be successful (e.g., internal resources, external partnerships), make the business case and ensure successful execution.
* Market Insight & Business Design: Gather and synthesize market research, customer insights, and competitive intelligence to inform strategic decisions. Leverage these insights to shape product direction, service design, and value propositions for new offerings and accelerate product market fit.
* Cross-Functional Leadership & Operational Readiness: Oversee cross-functional execution of initiatives by partnering closely with Product, Operations, Sales, Marketing, and other teams. Ensure alignment of priorities and coordinate efforts so that new initiatives move smoothly from concept to scale, taking into account the full end-to-end operating model (from B2B marketing materials to client reporting and sunsetting). Influence organizational decisions with limited direct control.
* Product Collaboration: Work hand-in-hand with Product Management and the Chief Product Officer to align the product roadmap with strategic market opportunities. Bring market-driven perspective to product development and utilize escalation paths when necessary to remove roadblocks or adjust priorities in support of growth initiatives.
* Go-to-Market Partnership: Collaborate with Sales, Client Management and Marketing teams to execute go-to-market strategies for new products or services. Support early customer acquisition by developing compelling messaging and value propositions and by engaging directly with key clients or partners as needed.
* Performance Management: Establish clear KPIs and success metrics for each initiative (e.g. learning velocity, user engagement, revenue growth, profitability). Monitor performance against these metrics and proactively adjust strategies to ensure initiatives are on track to meet both short-term milestones and long-term business objectives.
* Executive Communication: Serve as a strategic advisor to the executive leadership team regarding new growth initiatives. Provide regular updates, share insights and learnings, and make data-driven recommendations. Ensure stakeholders are informed, aligned, and excited about the strategic direction.

Qualifications:

* Bachelor’s degree in Business, Economics, or a related field is required. MBA preferred.
* 10+ years of progressive experience in strategy, product management, general management, or related roles. Demonstrated success in taking new products or business lines from concept to market and scaling them in ambiguous or high-growth environments.
* P&L ownership preferred.
* Experience with go-to-market strategy and market research is preferred.
* Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, including the ability to craft clear executive-level presentations and to inspire teams around a common vision. Comfortable engaging with C-suite leaders, key clients, and external partners.
* Exceptional leadership skills with a track record of influencing and coordinating cross-functional teams (e.g. product, engineering, sales, operations). Able to lead through influence in a matrixed or lean organization, and comfortable making decisions amidst organizational complexity
* Strong analytical and problem-solving capabilities. Data-driven in approach, with the agility to pivot when new insights emerge. Resourceful and resilient, able to navigate uncertainty and adapt strategies on the fly.
* Self-starter with an entrepreneurial spirit. Hands-on and “builder” mentality, willing to roll up your sleeves to get initiatives off the ground. Thrives in environments with a high degree of ambiguity and change.
* A genuine passion for health, wellness, and mission-driven work. Experience in the healthcare, fitness, or wellness industry is a plus, but an unwavering commitment to empowering healthier lifestyles is essential.
* Aligned with our company values and mission. A collaborative team player who can work effectively across departments and is motivated by the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the well-being of our members and communities.

The salary range for this opportunity is $175,000 to $215,000. Compensation depends on several factors: qualifications, skills, competencies, and experience.

Tivity Health offers a robust benefits package, which includes a competitive salary, company bonus potential, medical, dental, vision, 401k with match, generous paid time off, free gym membership to over 13,000 fitness locations in the US, and other great benefits.

* Evolve the role into a full C-suite growth and revenue leadership position post-funding
* Help guide expansion into future offerings including supplementation, diagnostics, meals, and advanced longevity services

**Who This Role Is For**

This role is ideal for someone who:

* Has **strong B2B sales and partnership experience**, ideally within health, wellness, or enterprise services
* Is deeply interested in **longevity, preventative health, and human performance**
* Is comfortable operating in an **early-stage environment** where upside replaces short-term certainty
* Has experience with:
* Cold outreach and relationship-driven sales
* High-performance selling
* Complex offerings that blend product + service
* Wants a **true executive trajectory**, not a capped sales role

**Qualifications**

* **10+ years of commercial experience**, with **5+ years in senior or executive leadership** (Director, VP, GM, C-level).
* **Direct experience in the longevity, health, digital health, or preventative care space is required.**
* Proven record of **driving B2B revenue and strategic partnerships**, ideally across clinics, gyms, employers, or health systems.

Upon the successful completion of our seed funding round and the transition into our next stage of growth, this role is designed to **convert into a full-time, salaried executive position (W-2 / FTE)**, with a market-competitive base salary, continued incentive compensation, and ongoing equity vesting.

**Compensation & Equity Structure - Pre-Funding (Current Phase)**

-----------------

Monaire is transforming how commercial buildings manage HVAC systems through AI-powered automation and insights. We combine sensors, smart thermostats, and machine learning to deliver massive energy savings, operational transparency, and sustainability impact.  
  
We’re not just another building-tech tool. Monaire has become the go-to platform customers rave about because it works immediately, deploys cleanly, and produces results that move the needle. The market is massive, broken, and wide open for a dominant player. We’re scaling fast and need a VP of Sales who can convert this demand into a disciplined, high-velocity revenue engine — someone who can build the team, enforce the process, and win the category.

**Role Overview**

We’re looking for a VP of Sales who can **build and scale a world-class sales team from the ground up**, impose operational rigor, and consistently outperform aggressive targets. This isn’t a “maintain the machine” role — it’s a **build, optimize, and win** mandate.

You will own revenue, hiring, coaching, processes, forecasting accuracy, and pipeline creation. You must be able to operate strategically *and* get your hands dirty in deals when needed.

If you can’t grow a team, fix weak pipelines, or call bullshit on bad forecasts, this role will expose that fast.

**Key Responsibilities**
========================

### **Team Building & Leadership**

* Build, scale, and lead a high-performing AE team with a culture of accountability, coaching, and constant improvement.
* Recruit A-players and remove low performers quickly — no tolerance for mediocrity in a hyper-growth environment.
* Implement repeatable hiring standards, onboarding, playbooks, and coaching systems.

### **Revenue Ownership**

* Own and deliver quarterly and annual revenue targets with precision.
* Drive disciplined pipeline development, deal velocity, and conversion rates.
* Set clear expectations and performance metrics; enforce them ruthlessly.

### **Sales Strategy & Execution**

* Architect a scalable sales model that aligns with Monaire’s product, market motion, and customer profile.
* Build territory design, quota models, comp plans, and forecasting frameworks that actually work.
* Collaborate tightly with founders, product, and marketing to refine positioning and accelerate adoption.

### **Process, Systems & Forecasting**

* Install CRM hygiene, reporting clarity, and operational guardrails that prevent surprises.
* Build the processes AEs *actually follow*, not theoretical decks.
* Maintain accurate forecasts and dashboards; no sandbagging, no wishful thinking.

### **Customer & Market Intelligence**

* Build relationships with key decision-makers (Facility Managers, Sustainability Directors, C-suite), handle escalations, and ensure successful onboarding.
* Bring structured feedback loops from the field into product and GTM teams.
* Understand customer ROI deeply and ensure AEs articulate it with conviction.
* Develop deep knowledge of HVAC management industry trends and competitor offerings.
* Identify new markets, verticals, and expansion paths — we’re barely scratching the surface of the opportunity.

### **Requirements**

### **Must-Have**

* Proven success scaling an AE team from early-stage to high-growth, ideally in B2B tech or HVAC/building tech adjacent markets.
* Demonstrable track record of hitting aggressive revenue targets for several consecutive years.
* The ability to design and run a sales engine, not just “manage reps.”
* Strong operational discipline — forecasting accuracy, pipeline scrutiny, data-driven decisions.
* Strong recruiter and coach; knows how to build a top-5% team.
* Comfortable with fast decisions, minimal bureaucracy, and founder-level expectations.

### **Nice-to-Have**

* Experience in IoT, building automation, HVAC, energy management, or proptech.
* Background selling hardware-plus-software solutions.
* Previously owned revenue in a Series A–C environment.

**What Success Looks Like in 12 Months**
========================================

* AE team scaled with consistent quota attainment across the board.
* Predictable pipeline generation with tight qualification discipline.
* Forecast accuracy within a reasonable tolerance — no fire drills.
* Revenue growth that materially outpaces market norms.
* A sales culture defined by accountability, transparency, and winning.

### **Benefits**

* Mission-driven: Reduce carbon emissions and operational costs for the built environment
* Early ownership: You’ll define how Monaire grows
* Fast feedback loop: Your campaigns will have visible, immediate impact on revenue
* Work with a sharp, motivated team of engineers, designers, and operators building category-defining tech
* Competitive base salary and meaningful equity

L & J. G. Stickley, Inc (Stickley) is a leader in the furniture manufacturing and retail industries, with brands that are respected and cherished worldwide. We're building something rare: a brand with a 125 year legacy, a supply chain we own, and a new D2C platform designed from the ground up. As Chief Revenue Officer, you'll lead the charge by aligning and scaling our three core channels- Retail, Wholesale, and E-Commerce- in concert. These channels must operate with clarity, discipline, and mutual reinforcement to deliver a unified brand experience and sustained growth. This newly created role is central to our next phase of growth and requires a special talent.

**General Description/ Purpose:**

You'll also partner closely with the VP of Strategic Growth Channels to maximize performance across OEM. To the Trade, and 3rd Party Marketplaces. These segments represent high-potential opportunities that require focused leadership, disciplined execution, and strategic expansion-with the CRO ensuring alignment across brand, margin, and customer experience.

**What You'll Lead:**

**Brand Stewardship & Extension** Translate our 125-year legacy into modern systems and storytelling. Extend brand equity across all channels with consistency and care.

**Channel Architecture & Portfolio Management** Oversee a residential portfolio that performs across all relevant channels. Ensure clarity, discipline, and channel harmony.

**Strategic Growth Channel Expansion** Partner with the VP of Strategic Growth Channels to unlock new market opportunities across OEM, to-the-trade, and marketplace segments.

**Customer Journey Modernization** Architect a seamless, modern experience across showroom, web, and post-purchase touchpoints. Ensure brand consistency and operational excellence.

**Margin Strategy & Operational Discipline** Leverage our vertically integrated supply chain to maintain strong consolidated margins and pricing clarity across all revenue streams.

**Team & Partner Alignment** Educate internal teams and external partners on pricing logic, brand positioning, and growth strategy. Build trust through clarity and shared success.

**What You Bring:**

* 10+ years in sales, marketing, or related field. Experience in furniture industry a strong plus.
* A proven track record of revenue leadership across multi-channel environments
* Experience scaling premium brands and launching new ones
* Ability to build a D2C ecosystem from scratch, including digital infrastructure, customer acquisition, and post-purchase experience
* A digital-first mindset-fluent in modern tools, platforms, and performance metrics
* Strategic fluency in pricing, margin logic, and customer segmentation
* Ability to lead with clarity, empathy, and precision
* Comfort navigating legacy and innovation-honoring what came before while building what's next

We're building the next generation of wellness companies that will transform lives while achieving significant market value. Our mission is to create brands that matter, scale them to tens or hundreds of millions in revenue, and position them for successful exits.

**Position Overview:**  We are seeking an entrepreneurial Chief Commercial Officer who thrives in the intersection of startup hustle and strategic scale. This is not a traditional CCO role – it's an opportunity to be the commercial architect of multiple high-growth wellness brands from inception to exit. You'll own revenue generation across our portfolio, build strategic partnerships that accelerate growth, and create commercial infrastructure that transforms innovative ideas into market-leading businesses.

***This role requires someone who has lived the startup grind and understands what it means to build from zero.*** In the early stages, you won't have a team to delegate to or a budget for contractors – you'll be the one making the calls, sending the emails, building the spreadsheets, and personally closing deals. We need a strategist who is also a doer, someone who can create the vision and execute it simultaneously without hesitation.

The ideal candidate combines the grit of a founder with the sophistication of a seasoned executive, capable of rolling up their sleeves in the early stages while maintaining the vision to build hundred-million-dollar enterprises. You must be comfortable operating as a team of one initially, building systems and processes yourself, and scaling only when revenue justifies investment in additional headcount.

**Core Responsibilities**

**Strategic Commercial Leadership**

* Develop and execute comprehensive commercial strategies across the entire brand portfolio, from pre-launch to scale to exit readiness
* Own full P&L responsibility for revenue generation, with direct accountability for top-line growth across all brands
* Design and implement scalable commercial playbooks that can be rapidly deployed for new brand launches
* Lead commercial due diligence and positioning for potential acquisitions or exits
* Establish KPIs and commercial metrics that drive portfolio valuation and exit multiples
* Personally execute foundational commercial work in early brand stages – you'll be building the initial sales decks, running first customer calls, and creating systems from scratch before you have resources to build a team

**Revenue Generation & Growth**

* Personally drive initial revenue generation for new brands – you'll be the first salesperson, closing early deals and proving the model before scaling
* Build and lead high-performing sales organizations from zero to scale, including direct-to-consumer, B2B, and retail channels only after demonstrating product-market fit and sustainable unit economics
* Create and optimize omnichannel distribution strategies that maximize market penetration and revenue per brand
* Develop pricing strategies that balance growth, profitability, and market positioning
* Architect customer acquisition funnels that drive sustainable unit economics through hands-on testing and iteration, not expensive agency relationships
* Own revenue targets ranging from first dollar to $100M+ per brand

**Partnership & Business Development**

* Personally lead outreach and relationship building with strategic partners, major retailers, and distribution channels
* Negotiate and structure transformational partnerships that provide unfair advantages in market access and growth
* Execute all aspects of partnership development initially – from prospecting and outreach to negotiation and contract management – without relying on business development support staff
* Build and nurture a powerful network of industry relationships across wellness, retail, digital commerce, and investment communities
* Identify and secure vendor partnerships that enhance operational efficiency and margin structure
* Develop co-creation and white-label opportunities with complementary brands and platforms

**Market Development & Expansion**

* Lead market entry strategies for new geographic territories and customer segments
* Pioneer new distribution channels and commercial models specific to health and wellness
* Build strategic alliances with healthcare providers, wellness practitioners, and community organizations
* Create innovative go-to-market strategies that leverage social impact for commercial success
* Conduct initial market research, competitive analysis, and customer discovery personally – you'll be in the trenches gathering intelligence, not directing a research team

**Operational Excellence**

* Design and implement commercial operations that can scale from startup to enterprise by first building them yourself with available tools and resources
* Build data-driven decision frameworks for resource allocation across the portfolio
* Create systems and processes that enable rapid testing, learning, and pivoting
* Build scrappy, resourceful solutions using available technology and tools rather than expensive custom builds or consultant engagements
* Establish commercial infrastructure that supports both aggressive growth and operational efficiency
* Lead cross-functional collaboration with product, marketing, and operations teams

**Team Building & Leadership**

* Initially operate as a one-person commercial department, proving scalability and ROI before building a team
* Recruit, develop, and retain world-class commercial talent across multiple brands only after revenue milestones justify investment in headcount
* Build a culture of commercial excellence that balances entrepreneurial creativity with disciplined execution
* Hire strategically and lean, prioritizing multi-skilled team members who share a willingness to do whatever it takes
* Mentor and develop brand-level commercial leaders who can operate with autonomy
* Create performance management systems that reward both individual achievement and portfolio success

**P&L Ownership Structure** The CCO will have direct P&L ownership with the following accountability framework:

* **Primary Revenue Ownership:** Full responsibility for top-line revenue across the entire portfolio
* **Margin Accountability:** Co-ownership of gross margin through strategic pricing and channel mix optimization
* **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** Joint ownership with marketing for CAC targets and payback periods
* **Sales Efficiency Metrics:** Complete ownership of sales productivity, conversion rates, and revenue per employee
* **Portfolio Allocation:** Authority to allocate commercial resources across brands based on growth potential and ROI
* **Investment Decision Rights:** Participation in investment decisions for commercial initiatives above specified thresholds
* **Exit Value Creation:** Shared accountability for revenue multiples and commercial metrics that drive exit valuations
* **Resource Efficiency:** Accountability for achieving aggressive growth targets with minimal overhead and lean operations\*\*

**Required Qualifications**

**Experience**

* \*REQUIRED: Minimum 5 years in a startup environment (seed through Series B) where you personally executed commercial functions with limited resources and team support
* \*REQUIRED: Proven track record of personally generating first revenue and building initial commercial traction for at least one startup (not just managing established revenue streams)
* 10+ years of progressive commercial leadership experience, with at least 5 years in senior roles
* Proven track record of building businesses from <$1M to $50M+ in revenue
* Direct experience in health, wellness, CPG, or lifestyle brands
* Demonstrated success in both D2C and retail/wholesale channels
* Experience thriving in resource-constrained environments where scrappy execution trumped big budgets
* Experience with M&A, fundraising, or successful exits preferred
* Track record of building and scaling teams from 5 to 50+ people after establishing proof of concept independently

**Skills & Competencies**

* **Startup DNA:** Deep comfort with doing whatever it takes – from cold calling to building spreadsheets to personally managing logistics – without considering any task ""beneath you""
* **Resourcefulness:** Expert at achieving outsized results with minimal budget through creativity, hustle, and strategic thinking
* **Execution Velocity:** Ability to move from strategy to implementation immediately, without waiting for perfect resources or conditions
* Entrepreneurial Mindset: Comfort with ambiguity, rapid iteration, and hands-on execution
* Strategic Vision: Ability to see around corners and position brands for long-term success
* Network Builder: Exceptional relationship-building skills with a robust existing network in wellness/CPG
* Data-Driven Decision Making: Strong analytical capabilities with ability to synthesize complex data into actionable strategies
* **Comfortable wearing multiple hats:** Can toggle seamlessly between high-level strategy and granular execution without missing a beat
* Cross-Functional Leadership: Proven ability to influence and align diverse stakeholders without formal authority
* Cultural Fit: Passion for health and wellness with authentic commitment to social impact
* Communication Excellence: Outstanding presentation and negotiation skills at all levels, from startup founders to Fortune 500 executives
* **Ego-Free Approach:** No task is too small; you understand that in startups, everyone does everything, and you embrace that reality

**What This Role Is NOT:** This is not a role where you'll immediately build a large commercial team or have substantial budgets for contractors, agencies, or external support. You won't have an SDR team, a business development coordinator, or an operations manager initially. You'll be doing this work yourself – prospecting, cold calling, building decks, managing CRM, analyzing data, negotiating deals, and creating processes. If you're expecting to come in and primarily direct others or delegate execution, this role is not for you. We need someone who gets energized by rolling up their sleeves and doing the actual work while simultaneously thinking strategically about scale**.**

**Performance Metrics**

* Portfolio revenue growth (minimum 100% YoY in growth phase)
* Revenue per brand milestones ($1M, $10M, $50M, $100M)
* Customer acquisition efficiency (CAC/LTV ratios)
* Distribution channel expansion (doors, platforms, partnerships)
* Portfolio valuation metrics (revenue multiples, EBITDA margins)
* Time to profitability per brand
* Strategic partnership value creation
* Team performance and retention
* Revenue per commercial FTE (demonstrating lean, efficient growth)
* Speed to first revenue for new brand launches

**Compensation Philosophy** This role offers a competitive compensation package designed to reward both near-term execution and long-term value creation:

* Competitive base salary commensurate with experience
* Performance-based bonus tied to revenue and growth metrics
* Equity participation in the incubator and/or individual brand vehicles
* Carried interest in successful exits
* Comprehensive benefits package

**The Opportunity** This is a rare opportunity to join a mission-driven organization at an inflection point. You'll have the autonomy to build commercial engines that scale, the resources to execute ambitious strategies, and the potential for significant wealth creation through our portfolio approach. You'll start by getting your hands dirty doing the foundational work yourself, proving models and strategies through personal execution, and eventually building teams as revenue justifies investment. This is the path from startup hustle to scaled enterprise – and you'll be the architect of both phases. If you're ready to move beyond traditional corporate roles and build something extraordinary in the wellness space, we want to hear from you.

**Equal Opportunity Statement** Pash Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to building a diverse and inclusive team. We celebrate different perspectives and experiences, knowing that diversity drives innovation and better serves our mission to improve health and wellness for all.

**To apply, please submit your resume along with a brief note explaining:**

* A specific example of a time you personally executed commercial work in a resource-constrained startup environment (what you did with your own hands, not what you directed others to do)
* Your vision for scaling a wellness brand from $0 to $100M
* What unique advantages you would bring to our portfolio approach

Job Type: Full-time

This is not a behind-the-desk role. This is for the leader who wants to create real impact, shape a fast-growing department, and help CraftBuilt become the dominant sales organization in the market.

**Ready to be a part of the company transforming FinTech and how the world accesses banking services?**

When was the last time you were excited about interacting with your bank or credit union? If the answer is, “a while,” then you’re in good company. Even though access to better financial choices is at the heart of empowering communities, businesses, and people, financial institutions (FIs) are struggling to keep up with modern expectations.

And that’s where Kinective comes in. We’re here to change the way the world accesses and thinks about banking through software that connects a historically “boring” industry to the latest and greatest fintechs shaping the industry

Ok... but what does all of that *actually* mean? Banks and credit unions are using some old-school systems, which make adopting new and innovative technology difficult (if not impossible). If you think it’s easy for your local branch to send you a receipt via text… think again.

Want proof? As the largest provider of software connectivity to 1 in 4 U.S. financial institutions, we are the leading company transforming the way banking is done for credit unions and banks. In fact, Forbes recently released their Best Banks in the World report, and Kinective works with over 60% of their named banks!

Kinective is the connector (get it?) that bridges that technology gap and helps modernize the way banking works. Our ~300 team of mega-talented and passionate folks are brought together with the unifying desire to make life easier (and better) for our clients and ultimately paving the way for banks and credit unions to modernize banking for everyone.

**The Cliffs Notes**

The Vice President of Fintech Partnerships will build and lead Kinective’s fintech partner organization, transforming our platform into a vibrant, scalable fintech marketplace. This leader will shape the strategy, develop the team, own critical partner relationships, and drive partner-sourced and partner-influenced revenue in close collaboration with Sales, Product, Marketing, and Operations.

**What you'll own:**

* Help build, shape, and sell the value of Kinective’s fintech ecosystem—bringing fintechs into our marketplace and aligning them to our broader strategy.
* Build and lead a high-impact team responsible for sourcing, securing, and growing fintech partnerships.
* Create the structure, governance, and metrics that guide fintech partner identification, onboarding, enablement, and growth.
* Drive fintech partner bookings with consistent, disciplined forecasting.

***Strategy & Ecosystem Design***

* Identify and prioritize the fintech partners that belong in Kinective’s ecosystem, ensuring each contributes meaningful value to our FI customers.
* Play a central role in designing and building Kinective’s fintech marketplace, delivering greater value for our FI customers and fueling long-term growth.
* Align with Product and fulfillment to ensure each target fintech use case is technically feasible, operationally supported, and scalable for our FI customers.
* Collaborate with other product lines—Document Workflow, Data Intelligence, and Branch—when fintech partnerships span multiple solutions.

***Team Leadership & Org Design***

* Design the fintech partnerships organization, defining hunter and farmer roles and how they integrate with direct Digital Connectivity sellers.
* Build a high-performing team—working with Partner Enablement to equip them for success.
* Lead as a player–coach—owning critical fintech relationships while driving clarity, accountability, and high performance across the team.
* Implement a disciplined operating rhythm, supported by consistent 1:1s, pipeline reviews, QBRs, and transparent dashboards that reinforce performance.

***New Fintech Acquisition***

* Establish a predictable, scalable hunting motion that unifies outbound prospecting, inbound demand, event activity, and referrals from the direct sales team and Partner Marketing.
* Leverage HubSpot scoring models and FI demand signals to prioritize a focused, high-quality pipeline of fintech opportunities.
* Personally lead the most strategic fintech pursuits—from early engagement through negotiation and execution—while ensuring clean handoffs to enablement and delivery.
* Deliver a targeted number of new, qualified fintech partners each year—each with defined use cases and a clear path to FI adoption, bookings and revenue.

***Partner Growth, Farming & Reactivation***

* Develop structured account plans and QBRs for existing fintech partners, emphasizing pipeline growth, execution discipline, and shared value creation.
* Develop co-selling and referral motions with partner sales teams to reach shared FI customers and grow Kinective connectivity adoption.
* Launch and lead a systematic re-engagement program for partners who have paid but are not engaged, creating clear activation plans and meaningful growth targets.
* Design commercial approaches that generate real bookings and revenue—not just strategic intent—while operating with the near-term rigor and accountability expected in a PE-backed organization.

***Partner Operations, Rules of Engagement & Governance***

* Define and uphold clear rules of engagement between Partner Sales and Direct Sales for referrals, enterprise upsells, and co-sell opportunities.
* Work closely with Sales Operations and Sales Enablement to ensure Salesforce data is accurate and that partner activity reliably initiates the correct internal workflows.
* Implement effective governance models for top partners, including defined executive sponsors, escalation paths, and decision-making cadences.
* Partner with Revenue Operations to ensure contract structures, SKUs, and supporting systems enable a scalable, repeatable partner motion—reducing reliance on ad hoc or one-off exceptions.

***Forecasting, Metrics & Performance Management***

* Own the fintech partner pipeline and bookings for Digital Connectivity, ensuring clear contribution to Kinective’s overall revenue plan.
* Deliver weekly forecasts and reports that transparently communicate progress, risks, and upside across partner acquisition, activation, and expansion.
* Enforce Salesforce discipline so partner-sourced and partner-influenced opportunities are visible, traceable, and accurately reconciled.
* Set clear expectations and manage commitments with the rigor, accountability, and precision required in a PE-backed environment.

**What you're great at:**

* *Cross-functional influence:* Effective at aligning Sales, Product, Marketing, Operations, and Finance around partner plans and priorities.

Requirements:

**Necessary Qualifications**

* 10+ years in B2B SaaS or fintech partnerships, alliances, or ecosystem roles with direct revenue ownership.

Work Where It’s Best for You

Work Anywhere means you can work in an office or at home on any given day. It’s about getting the work done in the way and place that works best for each person. This applies across all locations and departments.

Work Anywhere does not mean work at any time. We have predictable core hours where employees are generally available for meetings and collaboration. Employees are focused and available during core hours.

We invest in our offices to make them places where our employees like to go. If you work in the office three or more days a week, you will have a dedicated office workspace. Our offices function as hubs to draw people in, create social bonds, and where random connections and mixing of ideas happen. We’re investing more in offices, culture, and offsite meetings, not less.

Product teams are organized in regional product hubs for optimal collaboration and live within a time zone of their hub. Our current product hubs are located in Pleasanton, Columbus, Boston, Kansas City, New York City, Raleigh, and Toronto. We create opportunities for teams to get together in person regularly.

Customer-facing roles, such as Sales and Professional Services, live near and/or travel to their customers.

When an employee moves within a country it does not cause a change in salary. Where you live impacts you and your family. Not knowing if your compensation will change if you move can cause stress and uncertainty for everyone. We wanted to eliminate that.

Work Where It’s Best for You

Work Anywhere means you can work in an office or at home on any given day. It’s about getting the work done in the way and place that works best for each person. This applies across all locations and departments.

Work Anywhere does not mean work at any time. We have predictable core hours where employees are generally available for meetings and collaboration. Employees are focused and available during core hours.

We invest in our offices to make them places where our employees like to go. If you work in the office three or more days a week, you will have a dedicated office workspace. Our offices function as hubs to draw people in, create social bonds, and where random connections and mixing of ideas happen. We’re investing more in offices, culture, and offsite meetings, not less.

Product teams are organized in regional product hubs for optimal collaboration and live within a time zone of their hub. Our current product hubs are located in Pleasanton, Columbus, Boston, Kansas City, New York City, Raleigh, and Toronto. We create opportunities for teams to get together in person regularly.

Customer-facing roles, such as Sales and Professional Services, live near and/or travel to their customers.

When an employee moves within a country it does not cause a change in salary. Where you live impacts you and your family. Not knowing if your compensation will change if you move can cause stress and uncertainty for everyone. We wanted to eliminate that.

Are you a sales leader who can **build a high-performing team, install world-class process, and scale revenue fast -** while still rolling up your sleeves on big enterprise deals? This is your chance to lead the revenue engine at one of the fastest-growing social media engagement SaaS companies.

BrandBastion is at an inflection point: social has become the primary channel where brands are built, trust is won (or lost), and performance marketing lives and dies. AI is transforming how brands can engage at scale—but the winners will be the companies that combine automation with authenticity. That’s what we do.

We’re hiring a **VP of Sales** to take us to the next level by building the team, process, and operating system that scales. This is a **remote role**; the right person can be based anywhere as long as they can work hours aligned with selling to North America. The role reports to our CEO & Founder Jenny Wolfram.

### **About BrandBastion**

The vision for BrandBastion was born from seeing how major brands struggled to manage social media engagement at scale while maintaining authenticity. Since founding BrandBastion, we’ve grown explosively:

* Integrated with **Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube, Trustpilot**, and more

### **Why BrandBastion is Positioned for Massive Growth**

We’re in a rare window where:

* **Social media is the front door of every brand**
* The volume and speed of engagement has exploded
* **AI is making scalable engagement possible**, but brands still need a human layer to protect voice, handle nuance, and resolve crises

Unlike legacy social media management tools, we built BrandBastion from the ground up with **engagement at the center**—and for the AI era. We’re not just “managing comments.” We help brands create loyalty, protect reputation, and **drive measurable growth**.

**ABOUT BENCHMADE**

With a rich history dating back over 30 years, Benchmade is the product of many dedicated employees, a never-quit demand for excellence and the de Asis family’s vision and total commitment to culture, service and innovation. Les de Asis incorporated as Bali-Song®, Inc. and rented a small shop in a second-story mezzanine in California. The original equipment was purchased from the owner of a manufacturing operation who was looking to retire. Utilizing the rudimentary technology available to him at the time, Les began building handmade custom Bali-Songs, and the success of these custom Balis spurred the creation of the first production Bali-Song®: The model 68. Over the next seven years, the company expanded its product offerings into fixed blades and conventional folding knives, and evolved its name from Bali-song®, Inc. to Pacific Cutlery Corp. Due to its inability to control quality, price, and delivery, Pacific Cutlery Corp. filed for bankruptcy and was dissolved.

In 1988, Les reintroduced a new company and new version of the Model 68; This time with a drive to produce product in the US and an even stronger commitment to product availability, quality, and customer relationships. The company now needed a new name. While there was “handmade” and “factory-made,” it was “Benchmade” that described the quality of Les’ product. He was building an operation that made precision parts, but with hand assembly on the finished products. This was a “bench” operation, and Les wanted the name to reflect the marriage of manufactured and custom. In short, it describes Benchmade’s position in the market- even to this day.

Benchmade moved from California to a facility in Clackamas, Oregon, and began producing knives there under the name Benchmade, Inc. This was a major turning point, as the company was now located in the epicenter for knife manufacturing. Many technological advancements were now possible, and Benchmade became the first company to own and employ a high-power laser cutter, allowing for work with steels too hard to stamp. To this day, Benchmade continues to focus on innovation, customer needs, responsible business ethics, and operations to bring the highest quality products to the world’s elite. This is the story of Benchmade.

**We're powering biology's century** with radically faster, more reliable clinical trials. Every new treatment needs clinical trials to prove safety and efficacy, but today's infrastructure is stuck in the past- driving up cost, causing delays and ultimately meaning new treatments don’t get to patients. We're fundamentally changing that- not just being a ""better CRO,"" but transforming how people think about developing new treatments, so patients can access breakthrough treatments faster.

**Our impact speaks for itself:** Since March 2021, we've powered 100+ clinical trials involving tens of thousands of patients. We recently raised a $55M Series B from Balderton Capital, alongside backing from Creandum, Firstminute, Seedcamp, and Visionaries.

* Previous experience at a media agency, ad tech platform, or media company

**Compensation:**

* Base Salary: $150k-$200k; OTE $500k-$1M+
* Performance-based commissions AND quarterly bonuses (6–7 figure potential)
* Meaningful equity ownership with long-term 7-figure+ upside
* Comprehensive benefits (medical, dental, vision, wellness, disability, PTO, parental leave, 401(k))
* This role sits within the leadership layer guiding Mogul & Co. as it expands rapidly.

**Why Now?**

The media intelligence category is at an inflection point. As brands face mounting pressure to prove ROI and agencies compete to demonstrate strategic value, the ability to predict outcomes before dollars are spent has become a competitive necessity—not a nice-to-have.

Mogul & Co. is capitalizing on this moment. We're a fast-growing startup in the midst of significant expansion, with strong revenue momentum and increasing demand from agencies and enterprise brands who recognize that traditional media planning is no longer sufficient.

**Joining now means:**

* Ground-floor impact — You'll help build the commercial organization during our highest-growth phase, not after the foundation is set
* Category creation — We're not selling in an established market; we're defining what media intelligence means and how it transforms outcomes
* Accelerated growth — As we scale rapidly, so do the opportunities for those who contribute early and meaningfully

This is the window where your work has exponential impact—both on the business and your own career trajectory.

**What Makes Us Different**

Most agencies optimize media. Some analyze it. Very few can predict it.

Mogul & Co. sits at the intersection of innovative technology and real-world media execution. We're not a pure-play tech platform selling software, and we're not a traditional agency relying on experience and intuition. We're building proprietary predictive intelligence that merges cutting-edge AI and data science with

Where others report on what happened, we show clients what will happen. Where others manage campaigns reactively, we architect them proactively using intelligence that didn't exist before.

The result? Clients don't just get better performance—they get foresight, clarity, and confidence in every dollar invested. That's the difference, and it's why we're winning in a crowded market.

**Culture & Working Style**

We operate with the energy and urgency of a fast-paced startup, but we're not chaotic. We're intentional.

What that means day-to-day:

* Move fast, but with precision — We value speed and execution, but not at the expense of quality or strategic thinking
* High collaboration — Our hybrid model is designed for connection. We work cross-functionally, share insights openly, and believe the best outcomes come from diverse perspectives working in sync
* Ownership mindset — Everyone here is expected to think like a builder, not just an executor. You'll have autonomy, accountability, and the freedom to shape how we work
* Data-driven decisions — We don't rely on gut feelings or politics. We test, measure, learn, and adapt based on what the data tells us

Hybrid flexibility with purpose: We believe in-person collaboration drives breakthrough thinking and stronger relationships, so we prioritize time together. But we also trust our team to work effectively wherever they're most productive.

If you thrive in environments where things move quickly, where your contributions are visible and valued, and where you're surrounded by smart, driven people building something meaningful—you'll fit right in.

At Covera, we're committed to ensuring high-quality healthcare is more than just a promise. That's why we're leading the way in the emerging science of quality, and connecting providers and payers in their shared quest to improve patient outcomes and care quality. By tackling this challenge, we have the ability to impact millions of lives by raising the standard of care nationwide.

Our initial focus is radiology, where an early and accurate diagnosis has a profound impact on the rest of a patient's care journey. Through our work, which uses clinically-validated science-based tools, we're helping doctors enhance their care, ensuring patients get the right diagnosis, and enabling the healthcare system to support quality improvement at scale.

Through our clinical intelligence platform, we have launched programs that help people access the most effective care and provide doctors with AI-powered quality insights and tools to enhance their care. Today, Covera is partnered with leading employers, payers and healthcare organizations across the US, including Walmart and Microsoft. And, with a pipeline representing over 25% of insured Americans, we are in the early stages of improving care quality for all patients across the globe.

**About the Role**

Covera is looking for an extraordinarily driven, passionate commercial leader who thrives in fast-moving environments and knows how to build momentum inside complex provider organizations. This role is for someone who runs toward ownership, acts with urgency, and consistently turns ambiguity into action. You make things happen.

You'll accelerate Covera's growth across ACOs, physician organizations, clinically integrated networks, IPAs, and other value-based, risk-bearing groups. These organizations are under intense pressure to deliver higher-quality care, reduce unnecessary cost, and win in shared-savings and risk programs. Your job is to show them how Covera's quality intelligence and clinical accuracy programs help them perform better, improve patient outcomes, and strengthen their financial performance.

This is a quota-carrying individual contributor role owning the full enterprise sales cycle - from prospecting to contracting to the handoff into implementation.

**In this role, you will:**

* Develop, manage, and close high-value opportunities with ACOs, POs, CINs, IPAs, and multi-specialty groups in value-based arrangements

* Build trusted, strategic relationships with senior leaders across clinical, operational, quality, and financial functions
* Craft compelling, data-driven clinical and financial value narratives that resonate with risk-bearing organizations
* Clearly translate Covera's quality programs into measurable impact - better detection, improved outcomes, lower total cost of care, stronger program performance
* Work cross-functionally with Product, Clinical, and Analytics teams to ensure the solutions you shape directly address ACO performance goals
* Help shape our ACO-focused commercial strategy, messaging, and market presence
* Provide sharp, actionable market feedback to guide product and partnership roadmaps
* Represent Covera at industry events, conferences, and ACO coalitions to expand reach and build pipeline
* Operate with urgency, discipline, and a bias toward action every day - this role requires a true self-starter

**Special Considerations**  
This is a quota-carrying position with target total compensation including base salary plus variable incentive tied to sales performance

Covera is a remote-first company. The role requires regular travel to meet with clients, prospects, and partners, as well as to attend industry events (approximately 40-70%+ travel, based on the candidate's base location)

**Requirements**

* 10+ years of enterprise sales or business development experience selling into ACOs, POs, CINs, IPAs, provider networks, or risk-bearing entities
* A track record of closing complex, multi-stakeholder enterprise deals
* Deep familiarity with ACO models (MSSP and commercial), shared savings economics, risk-bearing structures, Medicare Advantage, population health, and quality performance
* Ability to tell a clear clinical, operational, and financial story across all layers of leadership
* Exceptional relationship-building skills with executive and physician leaders
* Strong communication ability - able to simplify complex concepts into persuasive, memorable narratives
* Comfort operating in a high-growth, fast-changing environment
* A motivated, urgent, self-starting mindset - you don't wait for direction and you don't let obstacles slow you down

**AI at Covera**  
Covera uses AI to elevate how we think, build, and execute. Every person on our team is responsible for using AI to accelerate workflows, strengthen communication, and uncover insights that drive better outcomes. AI enables us to focus on the work that creates the most value for our internal teams, partners, and patients, and it supports our mission to improve clinical quality at scale.

Final salary will be based on a number of factors including but not limited to, a candidate's qualifications, skills, competencies, experience, expertise and location. Final compensation decisions may occasionally fall outside of the posted range. Salary ranges are periodically reviewed and may be adjusted in response to market trends and company needs.
