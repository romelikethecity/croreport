# CRO Report: Market Holds at 164 Roles, AI Hiring Explodes Past SaaS, and Why Healthcare is the New Tech

## 📊 The Sales Executive Market

### 90-Day Snapshot

![90-Day Trend Chart](../trend_90_days.png)

**164 active roles, up 20% from last week's 137.** The January momentum continues.

Two weeks ago we saw the largest single-week surge since pandemic recovery (66 to 118). This week confirms it wasn't a fluke. We've not only held the gains but extended them. The 90-day chart shows a clear V-shaped recovery from the holiday floor, with each week building on the last.

### 5-Year Context

![5-Year Trend Chart](../trend_all_time.png)

**164 openings matches the 2022 peak.** We haven't seen this number since the tail end of the ZIRP hiring boom.

The question everyone's asking: is this sustainable? The trajectory matters more than the snapshot. We went from 66 (holiday bottom) to 118 to 164 in three weeks. That's not noise. Companies are filling roles they've been sitting on since Q3.

## What This Means

**Employed leaders:** You have options right now that didn't exist six weeks ago. If you've been waiting for leverage, this is the window.

**Job seekers:** Volume is up, but so is competition. Everyone who held off during the holidays is now active. Move fast on roles that match your profile. Waiting costs you.

**Hiring companies:** The power dynamic shifted. Strong candidates are fielding multiple conversations. If your process takes six weeks, you'll lose people to companies that move in three.

**Signal to watch:** Hold above 150 through February = sustained recovery. Drop back below 120 = Q1 budget flush that won't last.

---

## 🚀 Who's Moving

No major CRO announcements this week. Bobby Condon's move to Forward Networks (January 7) remains the most significant recent appointment, bringing his $2M-to-$480M Fastly playbook to the network digital twin space.

The absence of splashy moves while job volume increases suggests companies are building pipelines rather than closing searches. Expect a wave of announcements in February as Q1 hiring processes complete.

## 💼 This Week's Board Update

**164 active roles** across approximately **85+ unique companies** this week.

94% VP-level, 2% C-Level, 2% SVP, 1% EVP. Remote roles dominate at 73% of postings, up from 60% last week. Salary transparency sits at 24%, a notable decline from the 70% we saw in early January. Companies are posting more roles but being less forthcoming about comp.

Notable patterns: Healthcare and Technology are now tied for hiring volume. Financial services and education close behind. The "tech sales leader" category is fragmenting into vertical specializations.

---

## 🤖 The AI Narrative is Now Non-Negotiable

The most striking data point this week: **AI/Machine Learning mentions (403) now exceed SaaS (261) by 54%.**

This isn't a gradual shift. Six months ago, SaaS dominated job descriptions. Now AI appears in nearly a third of all sales leadership postings. The signal is clear: even if you're not selling AI products directly, employers want leaders who understand how AI transforms the sales function.

What this looks like in practice:

- "Experience implementing AI-powered sales tools" appearing in VP job descriptions
- "Understanding of AI/ML applications in [industry]" as a nice-to-have becoming a must-have
- GTM roles at non-AI companies explicitly asking for "AI GTM experience"

If your resume and interview talking points haven't evolved to include AI fluency, you're already behind. This doesn't mean fabricating expertise. It means having a perspective on how AI changes prospecting, qualification, forecasting, and coaching.

## 🏥 Healthcare is Hiring Like It's 2021

**Healthcare and Technology are now tied at 704 job mentions each.** That's not a typo.

For years, tech sales leaders have operated as if their only career path is company-to-company within SaaS. The data says otherwise. Healthcare (704), Education (613), Financial Services (566), and even Government (415) are absorbing sales leadership talent at rates that match or exceed pure technology companies.

Why this matters:

- **Larger addressable market for your career.** If you're only looking at "tech" companies, you're ignoring half the opportunity.
- **Different skills transfer more than you think.** Enterprise sales motion, stakeholder management, long cycles? Healthcare has all of that. The product changes. The job doesn't.
- **Less competition.** Every laid-off SaaS VP is applying to the same 50 late-stage startups. Meanwhile, healthcare systems and EdTech companies are struggling to find commercial leaders who understand modern GTM.

The smart move: stop filtering your job search by "industry: technology" and start filtering by "company type: growth-oriented."

## 💰 Compensation Benchmarking

**Data as of January 23, 2026** | 693 executive roles with disclosed salary out of 1319 total (55.2% disclosure rate)

![Compensation by Seniority](../comp_by_seniority.png)

![Compensation by Stage](../comp_by_stage.png)

![Compensation by Location](../comp_by_location.png)

### Highest Paying Roles This Week

1. **$380,000-$530,000**: VP, US Sales @ TripleLift (Remote)
2. **$410,000-$450,000**: Regional VP, Strategic Sales (West) @ Writer (San Francisco)
3. **$262,900-$404,200**: VP, Small Commercial Field Sales & Distribution @ Travelers
4. **$297,000-$367,500**: VP, Retail Sales - Home Entertainment @ Samsung Electronics
5. **$203,000-$357,000**: VP Sales, US Enterprise East @ Genesys

### What This Means for Negotiations

Average max base is down 1.3% over eight weeks ($252,819 to $249,626). Not a crash, but a drift. The headline-grabbing packages from 2021-2022 are gone. Market rate for VP Sales at a growth-stage company is $165K-$225K base. At enterprise/public companies, $170K-$265K.

The real negotiation leverage is in equity. At Series B/C, push for 0.25-0.5% to offset the base gap versus enterprise comp. Below $165K base for a VP role? You're leaving money on the table unless the equity is exceptional.

## 📋 What Employers Want

![Buzzwords & Trends](../insights_buzzwords.png)

### Buzzwords & Trends

"Scale" appears in 578 job descriptions. "GTM" in 476. "AI/ML" at 403 has officially surpassed "SaaS" at 261. The vocabulary of sales leadership has shifted. If your LinkedIn headline still says "SaaS Sales Leader," consider updating to "Technology Sales Leader" or "AI-Era GTM Executive." The semantics matter when recruiters are keyword-searching.

![Industry Focus](../insights_industries.png)

### Industry Focus

Technology/Software (704) tied with Healthcare (704). Education (613) and Financial Services (566) round out the top four. Cybersecurity (136) remains active despite broader tech layoffs. The enterprise security sales motion is alive and well.

![Sales Methodologies Required](../insights_methodologies.png)

### Sales Methodologies

Consultative selling leads at 171 mentions. MEDDIC/MEDDPICC at 116 is more prominent than last month, up from 31 in early January. Enterprise sales methodology at 101. Channel/Partner at 87 suggests indirect sales experience is valued beyond the usual channel-first companies.

PLG/Product-Led at just 16 mentions is interesting. Either PLG companies aren't hiring sales leaders, or they've stopped calling it "PLG" in job descriptions. Both seem plausible.

![Tools & Platforms in Demand](../insights_tools.png)

### Tools in Demand

Salesforce (177) is table stakes. Outreach (63) and HubSpot (46) are the only other tools that meaningfully register. Gong at 4 mentions? ZoomInfo at 5? Either these tools are so assumed they don't need mentioning, or the companies hiring don't run sophisticated sales tech stacks. The "modern sales stack" discourse on LinkedIn far exceeds actual hiring requirements.

## 📊 Market Intelligence

**20% weekly growth confirms January momentum.** 137 to 164 roles. The holiday recovery is real, not a one-week anomaly.

**AI mentions have permanently surpassed SaaS in job requirements.** 403 vs. 261. This shift happened faster than predicted. The AI fluency bar for sales leadership has risen in six months from "nice-to-have" to "table stakes."

**Healthcare hiring matches technology for the first time.** 704 mentions each. The fragmentation of "tech sales" as a career category is accelerating. Vertical expertise is becoming more valuable than platform/horizontal experience.

**Remote roles at 73% suggest permanent shift.** Up from 60% in early January. Companies are competing for talent nationally, not just in SF/NYC/Boston. This expands your options if you're looking, but also your competition.

**Salary transparency declining as volume increases.** 24% disclosure this week vs. 70% in early January. Companies posting more roles are being less transparent about comp. Ask for ranges early in the process.

## 🎯 Three Roles Worth Watching

### TripleLift, VP US Sales | Remote | $380K-$530K

The comp range is extraordinary for a VP role. TripleLift operates in programmatic advertising, a space that's been quietly consolidating. At $380K-$530K, they're paying for proven enterprise leadership, not upside potential. If you have ad tech or media sales background and can point to scaled revenue organizations you've built, this is one of the highest-comp VP roles on the market.

### Writer, Regional VP Strategic Sales (West) | San Francisco | $410K-$450K

Writer has been on a tear. Their enterprise AI writing platform sits at the intersection of AI hype and actual enterprise adoption. The West Coast Regional VP role at $410K-$450K suggests they're serious about building an enterprise motion. This isn't a "first sales hire at a startup" role. It's an expansion role at a company with product-market fit.

### Travelers, VP Small Commercial Field Sales | Hartford, CT | $262K-$404K

Insurance is boring. Insurance also pays. Travelers is one of the largest commercial insurers in the country, and they're paying VP-level comp ($262K-$404K) for someone to run their small commercial field sales. If you've been heads-down in SaaS and wondering what else is out there, commercial insurance has enterprise complexity, long relationship cycles, and comp that matches or exceeds tech.

## 🚫 Skip These Roles This Week

### Dental PC, Chief Revenue Officer | Jacksonville, FL | $110K-$130K

A CRO role at $110K-$130K is not a CRO role. This is likely an individual contributor or small-team manager position with an inflated title. The job description is legitimate (strategy, team building, revenue operations) but the comp doesn't match. If someone's offering you a C-level title at IC comp, something's wrong with the role, the company, or both.

### Reliant Care Management, Chief Revenue Officer | St. Louis, MO | Undisclosed

Healthcare revenue cycle management is a real and growing field. But a CRO role without disclosed comp in 2026 is a red flag. The job description is heavy on Medicare/Medicaid billing optimization, which is specialized work. If this is your background, worth a conversation. If you're coming from tech, the skills don't transfer as cleanly as the title suggests.
