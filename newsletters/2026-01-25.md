# CRO Report: Market Hits 164 Roles, Service Express VP Joins $50B Commerce Giant Rithum, and Interos's Federal Supply Chain Bet

Sales exec hiring up 20% to 164 roles as Q1 budgets unlock, Gregory Banning brings his enterprise sales playbook from Service Express to Rithum's global commerce platform, and why Interos's VP Federal Sales search signals the supply chain risk moment

## 📊 The Sales Executive Market

### 90-Day Snapshot

![90-Day Trend Chart](../trend_90_days.png)

**164 active roles, up 20% from last week's 137.** The January momentum continues.

Two weeks ago we saw the largest single-week surge since pandemic recovery (66 to 118). This week confirms it wasn't a fluke. We've not only held the gains but extended them. The 90-day chart shows a clear V-shaped recovery from the holiday floor, with each week building on the last.

### 5-Year Context

![5-Year Trend Chart](../trend_all_time.png)

**164 openings matches the 2022 peak.** We haven't seen this number since the tail end of the ZIRP hiring boom.

The question everyone's asking: is this sustainable? The trajectory matters more than the snapshot. We went from 66 (holiday bottom) to 118 to 164 in three weeks. That's not noise. Companies are filling roles they've been sitting on since Q3.

---

## What This Means

**Employed leaders:** You have options right now that didn't exist six weeks ago. If you've been waiting for leverage, this is the window.

**Job seekers:** Volume is up, but so is competition. Everyone who held off during the holidays is now active. Move fast on roles that match your profile. Waiting costs you.

**Hiring companies:** The power dynamic shifted. Strong candidates are fielding multiple conversations. If your process takes six weeks, you'll lose people to companies that move in three.

**Signal to watch:** Hold above 150 through February = sustained recovery. Drop back below 120 = Q1 budget flush that won't last.

## 🚀 Who's Moving

**Gregory Banning → Rithum as Chief Revenue Officer**

Previously: VP of Sales and Channels at Service Express ($400M IT managed services); earlier leadership roles at Adobe, Amazon, Capital One, SAP Concur, TD SYNNEX, and HNI

---

## 🎯 Company Deep-Dive

**Interos is hiring VP of Sales, Federal and A&D | $225K-$250K base + commission + equity | Remote | Reports to: Executive Leadership**

The only automated supply chain risk intelligence platform, serving Google, NASA, the US Navy, and the Department of Defense. Series D unicorn ($1B+ valuation) with $310M raised, now hunting for a leader to scale Federal and Aerospace & Defense sales as supply chain security becomes a national priority.

The opportunity: Build the commercial engine for government and defense at the intersection of AI and supply chain — the hottest policy space since cybersecurity. The question is whether Federal sales cycles and path-to-profitability pressure collide before this role hits its stride.

---

## 💼 This Week's Board Update

**164 active roles** across approximately **85+ unique companies** this week.

94% VP-level, 2% C-Level, 2% SVP, 1% EVP. Remote roles dominate at 73% of postings, up from 60% last week. Salary transparency sits at 24%, a notable decline from the 70% we saw in early January. Companies are posting more roles but being less forthcoming about comp.

Notable patterns: Healthcare and Technology are now tied for hiring volume. Financial services and education close behind. The "tech sales leader" category is fragmenting into vertical specializations.

## 🚀 Complete Movement Analysis

### Gregory Banning → Rithum as Chief Revenue Officer

**Previously:** VP of Sales and Channels at Service Express (2022-2025); earlier roles at Adobe, Amazon, Capital One, SAP Concur, TD SYNNEX, and HNI

**Background:** Gregory Banning is a 20-year enterprise sales veteran who's built his career scaling commercial organizations across both Fortune 500s and PE-backed growth businesses.

At Service Express, he led revenue strategy and execution for a $400M IT managed services business. Before that, he held leadership roles across a murderer's row of enterprise companies: Adobe, Amazon, Capital One, SAP Concur. His experience spans SaaS, technology, FinTech, retail, distribution, and manufacturing — with a consistent throughline of building high-performing teams and driving scalable, profitable growth.

He's known for combining operational rigor with what Rithum's announcement called "an authentic, people-first leadership style."

**Why This Move Matters:**

Rithum isn't a startup. It's a $50B GMV commerce infrastructure company formed from the 2022 merger of CommerceHub and ChannelAdvisor, rebranded in late 2023. They power product listing, fulfillment, and marketplace operations for 40,000+ brands, retailers, and suppliers across 420+ marketplaces.

Rithum just brought on a new CFO (Caitlin Hauser, also announced January 20) alongside Banning. Dual C-suite hires in finance and revenue signal one thing: the company is preparing for a liquidity event. With Insight Partners, GTCR, and Sycamore Partners as backers, the pressure to demonstrate growth trajectory is real.

Banning's mandate will likely be accelerating enterprise GTM while Rithum integrates AI capabilities (they launched RithumIQ in May 2025). His background selling complex enterprise solutions at scale — across IT services, SaaS, and commerce — maps directly to Rithum's customer profile: large retailers, brands, and suppliers who need their commerce operations to work.

## 🎯 Company Deep-Dive: Interos

**VP of Sales, Federal and A&D | $225K-$250K base + commission + equity | Remote | Reports to: Executive Leadership**

The first and only automated supply chain risk intelligence platform, with customers including Google, NASA, the US Navy, L3Harris, and the Department of Defense. Series D unicorn status, $310M+ raised, and a January 2026 funding round suggest momentum — but they're also targeting breakeven by year-end, which creates pressure.

### The Opportunity

This is a "build and lead" role. You're scaling a Federal sales org from early stage. The job spans revenue performance, pipeline health, account strategy across DoD, Intelligence Community, Civilian agencies, and Aerospace & Defense. You'll recruit and develop sellers while staying hands-on in deals.

$225K-$250K base, commission plan, and stock options for a VP-level Federal sales role at a unicorn is competitive but not top-of-market. The equity component matters here.

### Funding & Financial Position

- **Stage:** Series D, Unicorn ($1B+ valuation)
- **Total Raised:** ~$310M
- **Recent Funding:** $20M in January 2026 from Blue Owl Capital and Structural Capital; $40M in October 2024
- **Key Investors:** Blue Owl Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Venrock, NightDragon, Accenture Ventures, ServiceNow, Coupa Ventures
- **Headquarters:** Arlington, VA (remote-first)

Kleiner, Venrock, and strategic investments from Accenture, ServiceNow, and Coupa. But CEO Ted Krantz has publicly stated the company is targeting breakeven by end of 2026. That's not a red flag per se, but it does mean this role comes with growth expectations and cost discipline simultaneously.

**Key question:** What's the path to profitability, and how does Federal sales factor into that timeline?

### Leadership Intel

**Ted Krantz** became CEO in April 2024, joining from data.ai where he drove significant recurring revenue growth. His background includes C3.ai, SAP America, and Oracle — deep enterprise SaaS experience with a track record of scaling AI companies.

**Jennifer Bisceglie** founded Interos in 2005 and now serves as Founder & Executive Vice Chair. She was an early visionary on supply chain risk and built the company over nearly two decades before bringing in Krantz to scale.

This is a founder-influenced, professional-CEO-led company. Bisceglie sets vision and strategy; Krantz executes. Your success depends on alignment with both.

**Key question:** How involved is the founder in Federal sales strategy? What's the CEO's philosophy on sales org autonomy?

### Why This Could Be Compelling

**Supply chain risk is having its moment.** Post-pandemic disruptions, chip shortages, geopolitical tensions, and regulatory pressure (CHIPS Act, CMMC, etc.) have made supply chain visibility a national security priority. Interos is the category leader with real government traction.

**Serious customer logos.** Google, NASA, US Navy, L3Harris, Department of Defense, Canada's Coast Guard and Royal Navy — deployed contracts, not pilots.

**First-mover advantage.** Interos essentially created the supply chain risk intelligence category. Competitors exist, but none with this combination of AI capability, data depth, and government credibility.

**The investor signal.** Kleiner Perkins, Venrock, NightDragon plus strategic investments from Accenture, ServiceNow, and Coupa. This is the investor profile of a company that could IPO or get acquired at a premium.

### Major Red Flags

**Federal sales cycles are brutal.** 12-18+ months is standard. You need existing relationships, clearance credibility, and patience. If you're coming from commercial SaaS, the learning curve is steep and the feedback loops are slow.

**Breakeven pressure.** Targeting profitability by end of 2026 while scaling a Federal sales org creates tension. Sales leaders in this position often face simultaneous pressure to grow revenue and control costs. Ask explicitly how these priorities are balanced.

**"Frequent travel" required.** Federal sales means being in DC, at defense conferences, and on-site with customers regularly.

**The comp ceiling.** $225K-$250K base is solid but not exceptional for a VP Federal role at a unicorn. The equity and commission structure need to make up the difference. Get the details before committing.

### Sales Organization Intel

- **Reports to:** Executive leadership (likely CEO or CRO)
- **Scope:** Federal (DoD, IC, Civilian) and Aerospace & Defense
- **Team:** Building and scaling — expect to recruit
- **Customer profile:** Government agencies, defense contractors, critical infrastructure
- **Sales cycle:** Long (12-18+ months), complex, multi-stakeholder
- **Competition:** Emerging category with supply chain visibility competitors

### Compensation (Full Breakdown)

- **Base:** $225,000-$250,000 (disclosed)
- **Variable:** Commission plan (not disclosed — ask for structure)
- **Equity:** Stock options included
- **Estimated OTE:** $350,000-$450,000 depending on commission structure

**Analysis:** The base is market-rate for Federal VP roles but below what some defense tech unicorns pay. The equity component is critical — get the strike price, vesting schedule, and understand how close to IPO/exit they realistically are.

**Key question:** What's the commission structure, and what were top performers paid last year?

### Critical Questions

1. **What's the path to breakeven, and how does Federal revenue factor in?** Is this role expected to contribute to profitability, or is it a growth investment?

2. **What does the current Federal pipeline look like?** Am I building from scratch, or are there deals in motion?

3. **Who are the key Federal relationships today?** Is there a champion internally who owns DoD/IC relationships, or is that this role's mandate?

4. **What's the team structure?** How many sellers am I inheriting vs. recruiting? What's the budget for headcount?

5. **How do commercial and Federal sales orgs interact?** Is there channel conflict with enterprise accounts that have both commercial and government business?

6. **What's the equity situation?** Shares, strike price, vesting, and realistic timeline to liquidity event.

7. **What happened to the previous Federal sales leader?** Is this a new role, a backfill, or a restructure?

### Bottom Line

This is a chance to build the Federal sales engine for a category-defining supply chain AI company at exactly the moment when supply chain security has become a national priority. The customer logos are real, the investor backing is strong, and the timing couldn't be better for this category.

But Federal sales is hard, the company is balancing growth with profitability pressure, and the comp needs equity upside to be truly competitive.

**If you're considering this:**

- Understand equity: shares, strike price, 409A valuation, path to liquidity
- Clarify the breakeven timeline and how Federal sales fits
- Ask about team budget and hiring authority

**Best fit:** Experienced Federal/A&D sales leader with existing DoD/IC relationships, clearance (or clearable), and patience for long cycles. Someone who's built Federal sales orgs before and can operate with both growth mandate and cost discipline.

### Highest Paying Roles This Week

1. **$380,000-$530,000**: VP, US Sales @ TripleLift (Remote)
2. **$410,000-$450,000**: Regional VP, Strategic Sales (West) @ Writer (San Francisco)
3. **$262,900-$404,200**: VP, Small Commercial Field Sales & Distribution @ Travelers
4. **$297,000-$367,500**: VP, Retail Sales - Home Entertainment @ Samsung Electronics
5. **$203,000-$357,000**: VP Sales, US Enterprise East @ Genesys

### What This Means for Negotiations

Average max base is down 1.3% over eight weeks ($252,819 to $249,626). Not a crash, but a drift. The headline-grabbing packages from 2021-2022 are gone. Market rate for VP Sales at a growth-stage company is $165K-$225K base. At enterprise/public companies, $170K-$265K.

The real negotiation leverage is in equity. At Series B/C, push for 0.25-0.5% to offset the base gap versus enterprise comp. Below $165K base for a VP role? You're leaving money on the table unless the equity is exceptional.

## 📋 What Employers Want

![Buzzwords & Trends](../insights_buzzwords.png)

### Buzzwords & Trends

"Scale" appears in 578 job descriptions. "GTM" in 476. "AI/ML" at 403 has officially surpassed "SaaS" at 261. The vocabulary of sales leadership has shifted. If your LinkedIn headline still says "SaaS Sales Leader," consider updating to "Technology Sales Leader" or "AI-Era GTM Executive." The semantics matter when recruiters are keyword-searching.

![Industry Focus](../insights_industries.png)

### Industry Focus

Technology/Software (704) tied with Healthcare (704). Education (613) and Financial Services (566) round out the top four. Cybersecurity (136) remains active despite broader tech layoffs. The enterprise security sales motion is alive and well.

![Sales Methodologies Required](../insights_methodologies.png)

### Sales Methodologies

Consultative selling leads at 171 mentions. MEDDIC/MEDDPICC at 116 is more prominent than last month, up from 31 in early January. Enterprise sales methodology at 101. Channel/Partner at 87 suggests indirect sales experience is valued beyond the usual channel-first companies.

PLG/Product-Led at just 16 mentions is interesting. Either PLG companies aren't hiring sales leaders, or they've stopped calling it "PLG" in job descriptions. Both seem plausible.

![Tools & Platforms in Demand](../insights_tools.png)

### Tools in Demand

Salesforce (177) is table stakes. Outreach (63) and HubSpot (46) are the only other tools that meaningfully register. Gong at 4 mentions? ZoomInfo at 5? Either these tools are so assumed they don't need mentioning, or the companies hiring don't run sophisticated sales tech stacks. The "modern sales stack" discourse on LinkedIn far exceeds actual hiring requirements.

## 📊 Market Intelligence

**20% weekly growth confirms January momentum.** 137 to 164 roles. The holiday recovery is real, not a one-week anomaly.

**AI mentions have permanently surpassed SaaS in job requirements.** 403 vs. 261. This shift happened faster than predicted. The AI fluency bar for sales leadership has risen in six months from "nice-to-have" to "table stakes."

**Healthcare hiring matches technology for the first time.** 704 mentions each. The fragmentation of "tech sales" as a career category is accelerating. Vertical expertise is becoming more valuable than platform/horizontal experience.

**Rithum's dual C-suite hire signals liquidity event preparation.** New CRO and CFO announced the same day. When PE-backed companies bring in both revenue and finance leadership simultaneously, they're not thinking about survival. They're thinking about exit.

**Supply chain risk is the new cybersecurity.** Interos's Federal hiring push reflects broader market reality: post-pandemic, post-Ukraine, post-chip shortage, supply chain visibility has become a national security priority. Federal sales leaders with this domain expertise are in demand.

## 🚫 Skip These Roles This Week

### Dental PC, Chief Revenue Officer | Jacksonville, FL | $110K-$130K

A CRO role at $110K-$130K is not a CRO role. This is likely an individual contributor or small-team manager position with an inflated title. The job description is legitimate (strategy, team building, revenue operations) but the comp doesn't match. If someone's offering you a C-level title at IC comp, something's wrong with the role, the company, or both.

### Reliant Care Management, Chief Revenue Officer | St. Louis, MO | Undisclosed

Healthcare revenue cycle management is a real and growing field. But a CRO role without disclosed comp in 2026 is a red flag. The job description is heavy on Medicare/Medicaid billing optimization, which is specialized work. If this is your background, worth a conversation. If you're coming from tech, the skills don't transfer as cleanly as the title suggests.
